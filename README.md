# 00_Amazon_Reviews_Analysis

<b>Problem Statement:<b>
- With amazon nearing ½ billion products, users turn to reviews to inform their purchase decisions. The question is how helpful is each review?

<b>Understanding the Problem<b>
- Yelp has an algorithm that classifies reviews as “recommended” or “not-recommended” and is very effective at maintaining an honest review of each establishment.
- Amazon removes reviews it deems unauthentic or that violate its Terms of Use. However many “unhelpful” reviews seem to remain. Sellers can also be maliciously attacked when competitors order blatently obvious reviews for another seller, forcing Amazon to automatically shut the seller down.

<b>What is an Unhelpful Review?<b>

Unhelpful reviews can be any combination of the following:
- Too Short.
- Too Long.
- Too complicated to read.
- Too simplistic.
- Overly negative
- Overly positive
- Containing toxic or otherwise strong negative sentiment.
- Falsified or dishonest.
- Incentivised
