15113,15114,"Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time.  Rarely do you find a biography this well-written. When you finish this book you have to ask yourself: What kind of person works hard to get out of poverty and then becomes so obsessed with a cause that he gives up everything he has worked for, a loving wife and family, a lucrative business, his dignity, and any income at all to follow a cause that he feels only he can accomplish. Author Timothy Egan has given us a great gift in writing this biography.",16.0

The response from the genius tech when I brought mine into the apple store today was: ""All batteries are going to explode, just don't lick the acid!"".

15122,15123,"Bought this because my father in law has dementia and has gone for walks and gotten lost. We have a security system that alerts me when he opens the door, but it doesn't tell me if he comes right back in, or goes for a walk, so I needed something that lets me know if he is in the house or not. This looked like a perfect tool to keep track of him.It couldn't have been easier to set up! All you have to do is follow the directions in the setup CD. Anyone that complained about having trouble setting it up obviously didn't read/follow the directions, because it clearly says:  ""CONNECT CAMERA TO YOUR ROUTER""!!!Connecting it to your laptop will not allow it to communicate with the router!It took me about 5 minutes to have it up and working. The picture is clear, the audio is clear, and the website allows you to watch in real time. Make sure to get the My D-Link Lite app for your Android, so you can watch the camera from anywhere. I'm amazed that the website doesn't charge a subscription fee, it's awesome!The 4' power cord is long enough to have it plugged in and set the camera on top of my roll top desk, if you need a longer cord, get a cheap extension cord from Home Depot for $3.I'm going to be ordering another of these to give me another view of inside my house and one of the night vision cameras to watch the front of my house.",26.0
15123,15124,Nice looking functional stand.  Well finished (both the wood and the rubber contact areas)I paid $28 for it which I thought was a fair price.When it was delivered I thought I'd buy a couple more - but the price had increased by more than 50%The price increase coincided with the 2015 NAMM show - something I suspect that wasn't a coincidence.For the price I paid I give it 4 stars.

I was concerned it might not fit in which case I would simply return it, but it fits like a glove all the way to the ground. The material is very thick and feels like quality stuff.

15133,15134,"I have bought and used at least 12 aftermarket batteries (not this same brand) over the last 10 years for various digital cameras.  Haven't ever had a single problem with any of them - until now.  I bought this particular one because it claims its cells are made in Japan.  This Maximal Power battery seemed to work fine in my G1X for a while (probably 12-15 complete chargings) and then just suddenly quit functioning this morning while on vacation in Mexico (the battery must have thought it was on vacation too).  The Canon charger shows that the battery is fully charged and so does the camera when I turn it on.  The camera stays on only about 15 seconds and then shuts down.  I've tried recharging several times, wedging the battery into the charger and camera tighter, etc. to no avail. Fortunately I still have the original Canon battery and it works perfectly.  This particular backup battery is definitely inferior to the original Canon batteries and all the other aftermarket batteries I've owned.  I'll start shopping for a better one when I get home.I see that another reviewer had the same failure with this battery.  Stay away from this brand.  There are better ones out there.",36.0

15142,15143,"Céleste is a young French woman living in a small village in France during World War II. German soldiers are living in the village and most of the French residents are not happy with the occupation.  Céleste’s brother is a member of the French resistance. Céleste wants to join the cause, however, her brother won’t let her in an effort to keep her safe. However, when her brother is arrested, she feels that she has to join the resistance to help him escape.You would think this is enough stress for one character to endure. You’d be wrong. Not only is  Céleste a member of the resistance, she’s also a young woman in love. With a German officer. Yep, you read that right. While she’s fighting against the Germans, she is also in a secret relationship with one. That’s not all for the twists and turns, but I don’t want to ruin the novel.I have to admit that I wasn’t too familiar with this part of the war before reading this. I had heard that the German occupation of France was peaceful for the most part. This novel shows how devastating the occupation was to the individuals and families who had to endure it. I found myself cheering on  Céleste and her compatriots.The plot kept me engaged and I found myself rushing through to the end to find out what would happen. Every time I thought poor  Céleste wouldn’t be able to handle any more, there was yet another hurdle for her to overcome. She didn’t always make the right choice, but she was brave throughout. I admired her determination, overlooked her impetuosity (she’s only 19 at the start of the story), and wanted her to succeed even though the odds were against her. You’ll have to read for yourself to find out if she did. This story shows the true brutality of war, even on the “peaceful” fronts, and it highlights how brave people can be during such a horrific time in history.",51.0

15145,15146,"When I first received this bag in the mail, I thought it was too small to hold my gear. Was I wrong. The main compartment holds my Canon 5DMK II, 24-105, 200 2.8, 17-40, Sigma 85 1.4, battery charger, remote shutter release, a small Canon flash, and still has a little room for one or two other small things. One of the inner plastic envelopes holds the camera instruction book, the other holds batteries, both with room to spare. The two outer compartments hold my neutral density filters, filter holder, lens cleaners, and pocket flashlight, and there's still more room. The two pockets on either side perfectly hold a 77mm filter case. And I can attach my big Manfrotto tripod to the tripod holder.The bag is sturdy and small enough to fit under an airplane seat.

15151,15152,"Like several other reviewers I'd been using SM58's until trying these out and was blown away. We use these for vocals in both a rehearsal studio environment and live performance. They run thru dbx 286A preamp/compressor/gates in normal use but when we got the first one I a/b tested it against the Shure straight into the console as well. Here's my rundown:  * sonically they have wider response, just a little bit more at the bottom and noticeably more extension at the top. To my ears it's slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off.  * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58's. On the other hand, our singers have to remember to sing more directly into the mic. Minimal proximity effect as well. Plosives are well controlled, about the same as the Shure.  * sturdy construction, minimal handling noise, good weight balance, feels slightly heavier than the 58.  * first reaction when the band saw them was ""ooo sexy"". I dunno about sexy but it IS a nice looking mic.  Overall these are a nice improvement. I have now replaced my 58's with e835's and could hardly be happier with the results. Microphone qualities are highly subjective so listen to both back to back if at all possible, and decide for yourself! The e835 may not be right for you but in my case have exceeded expectations.",54.0

It offers excellent protection & will save your iPad from what ever accident may occur - obviously within reason.It's a great looking case - sleek & stylish with professional appearance (Matte Black rubberized plastic). The cover is magnetic like the Apple offering & folds nicely to be used as a stand.

15189,15190,"My review is of the Cohen Films restoration of the Thief of Bagdad (Blu-Ray).If you're well versed on this movie or at least becoming aware, I can't stress enough how badly you need this version in your collection. Back in 1986 or 1987 PBS aired this movie a long with a adapted score by Carl Davis. From the different versions I've seen of this film, they'll attach Nikolai Rimsky Korsakoff's ""Sheherazade"" to the movie and call it a day. Carl Davis meticulously fitted the music of the same score to the scenes and added pieces of original music himself. It makes the film take on an entirely different character that leads to one of the most moving finales that I can remember. The restoration of the film is nothing short of wonderful picture quality wise, and the Carl Davis score is as complimentary as people remember it. It's worth every penny, get it while it's available.",26.0

For slightly more money than a 5 ton, this baby has split everything I've thrown at it, including Oak, Cherry and Dogwood. Of several cords, I've only had to ""turnaround"" about three logs to get the proper leverage. It's quiet, efficient and easy to get used to. I think the best splitting method is to start the split on low speed and, once the ""crack"" is heard or felt, let the machine speed through the rest. It is rated for 12"" maximum diameter, but I've got up to 16"" without a problem. Once in a while, with really green wood, the splitter won't complete the job and some shards will remain, holding the two halves together. Then you have to resort to elbow grease. But I believe this to be true with any splitter, gas or electric.Overall, a great buy that has already paid for itself, and should continue to for many years.",30.0

15238,15239,"I bought a set of six of these via Kickstarter, and have had them since April.  The range is OK for indoor applications, if you want to spend $25 to track a $9 TV remote.  The range is really not good enough to go much further, unless you have line-of-sight (in which case, why use a tracker rather than your eyes?  Well, the leash function would be the answer - put a sticker on each of my bags, maybe on my coat, and if I walk off without the in an airport (or they walk off without me) then make my smartphone alert me.  That would be the ideal application.  The trouble is that for the leash (or other) functions of the software to work... the app must be active in the foreground of the smartphone, which also has to be awake.  Thus to have these track my bags I have to watch the iPhone and keep tickling it to stay awake (and not use it for other things).

I thought I would give the lower price range tablets a try due to financial concerns. I have to say initially I was very much hoping that I would just go straight over to this coby and not have a issue. Wrong.....  For the first week it kept turning on and off intermittently (and at the worst times), then it would freeze and need to be restarted. I hated the thing and was ready to return it. However, after the initial 30 or so reboots i think that it finally had the libraries where it wanted them to be.  I really feel like i got a good deal for the money.  I dont use face book so i cant say how that works, but I do stream netflix, I do play a ton of apps ( forget using the amazon appstore its not worth it and i used it religously before the change over), and i listen to tons of music. It does all of these things great. I have found new appstores GOOD E Reader appstore is a good one to start with. It does all of these things just fine. It has a really good sound from the one external speaker it has.

15301,15302,"[[VIDEOID:mo1DID2BXNY6471]]I've been using this box for a little over a month, and it fits the PlotWathcer Pro perfectly, as noted in other reviews. I purchased the Masterlock cable as well, and the box accommodates the cable passthru, exactly aligned with the Plotwatcher Pro's accompanying holes, just below the treestrap passthru slots, though the box does not have a slot for that strap (it's really not necessary, I don't think.).The only problem is with HEAT BUILDUP. The Plotwatcher Pro has an operating temperature range of -20F to 110F (as noted in the owners manual). My camera, mounted inside this box and in direct sunlight, during the heat of the summer, has gone as high as, I swear to you: 142F! (Please see the short video clip provided, showing the high temp on the bottom right, with a passing fox included!) This will likely shorten the life of the camera, as well as possibly void the warranty. It would be a nice feature of the camera if it shut down once it reached maximum operating temperature, but it appears that is not the case with this particular camera.Granted, where a lot of cameras might be mounted would be in the shade along pathways or along field edges, but mine does not see much shade except in the morning.It MAY compromise, somewhat, the security of this box, but I believe a few ventilation holes might be in order, and/or, as my husband is fixing to finagle, a little canopy over the top.Again, the box is a perfect match for the PlotWatcher Pro outside of this easily remedied issue.I hope this helps.",24.0

The picture will appear as though in slightly diffused light. This is because the VCR unit isn't top quality. Not enough reading heads. But the audio will knock your socks off! It's a very small hitch in your get along, though. You do not have to try to re-purchase that rather large library you built up over twenty plus years.

15422,15423,"A friend gave me a bottle of this company's coconut creme syrup as a gift and I made the mistake of using the recommended amount according to the package (1 3/4 pumps to 8 oz of cold coffee). The drink was so sweet it was undrinkable. So I dumped the whole thing into a 24 oz tumbler and added another 12 oz of coffee. It went from awful to the best coconut coffee I have ever had.I absolutely love blackberry so was thrilled when I saw this company makes a blackberry syrup. After reading the other review I almost didn't get it. But I remembered my first use with the other flavor and decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I did! When I first opened the bottle I tried I tiny drop of the syrup straight and it was very strong. Previous review said it was almost medicinal and I will agree with that assessment...but only until you use it as it was intended. We made Italian sodas and used a single pump per soda (other brands need 3-5 pumps).  My husband said it was the best berry flavored soda he's had and I have to agree.You cannot compare this product with Torani syrups unless you use it in the correct amounts. A serving size of Torani is 1 oz. A serving of Amoretti is 1 pump (pump is included)! Same sized bottles give you drastically different cost per servings. A 25.4 oz bottle of this syrup is 94 servings vs Torani's 25. It also means you are about only half the calories (this is also determined by the flavors you select) and, in my opinion, a truer flavor...and last I checked Torani was a couple dollars a bottle more. (Though Amoretti's flavor is worth a higher price...I love that they are cheaper!)This is definitely our new ""go-to"" brand for flavored syrups!",56.0

15441,15442,"This gauge is a little gem.  The design makes it easy to hold and use, and the illuminated red LED readout, which maintains the pressure reading for about 5 seconds after you pull it away from the tire valve stem, makes it very easy to see the pressure reading you get.Pressing it on the tire stem is effortless, and there is virtually no air loss when you press it in place, and remove it. The reading agrees with that on my wonderful Goodyear i8000 120-Volt Direct Drive Tire Inflator, but the precision of its readings is probably a good deal better.I like to inflate my tires about one pound too high, and then use the pressure gauge, pressed against the valve stem needle, to release the extra air until additional measurement with the gauge yield the correct pressure.

15557,15558,"I bought three to put around the car when my newly permitted teenager wants to practice her driving.  Though she doesn't want them on while around school, it has been very helpful when she's driving.  New drivers who are cautious can quickly become very nervous when other drivers are too close, both along the side or from behind.  When rude drivers started honking, riding the bumper, or cutting quickly in front of her while learning to drive, the behavior changed once we started using the signs.  The signs are easily recognized and can be placed on the car with enough magnetic force that I don't worry about them flying off.  And other drivers seem to be a little more patient or stay farther way.  This has greatly reduced the stress of learning to drive around others.  These signs make the car look more like the professional driver training cars, so she's not embarrassed to have them on while learning.",22.0

First I thoroughly I cleaned my tile. This is completely essential. Then I just rubbed the applicator along the grout lines like shoe polish. The product's consistency and effect is almost exactly like shoe polish, actually. It's just a white stain that covers the discolored grout. There is no strong odor to worry about. I waited a couple of hours then just took a damp cloth to rub off the excess that was on my tile and now all of the yellow is gone.  Some of the darker stains on the grout required a couple of coats, but that was no bother. My whole kitchen looks cleaner now. I would absolutely recommend this.",32.0

15574,15575,"I am very glad to have been approached by HCF to review their product.  I received, and started taking, HCF a little over 3 weeks ago.  When I got it, I was pleased to see the amount of literature that came with it—a nice breakdown of what it will do and how it will do it.  I started taking it in the evenings, when I take my other vitamins.  I did notice that for the first few nights I had a minor headache, but that passed within a week.  Obviously there is no immediately noticeable effect, but around the end of week 2 I started to notice a subtle difference in my ability to focus, stay on task and handle surprises.  Like other reviewers have indicated, this is not a magic pill that creates a dramatic moment—no switch flipped, if you follow me.  I've been struggling to find the words to explain it.  Before HCF, if I I was easily distracted from task on hand.  After HCF, I just do the task—no great epiphany, I am just able to focus on what needs to be done and do it without the distractions.  I find that my general outlook is a little bit sunnier—I’m not as inclined to become exasperated by changes of plans and find it a little easier to go with the flow.  Again, this isn't a profound change, just a nice subtle effect similar to what one experiences after a few weeks of taking a multi-vitamin.The best advice I can offer is to give it a try and see for yourself!",37.0

15644,15645,"I bought this clock radio for my husband for Christmas, thinking he could charge his iPhone, IPad, and iPod conveniently in one spot.  Turned out to be much harder in real life, as the iPad can't be in a case, and there were other issues with his new iPhone, the details of which I didn't bother to ask.  He is quite savvy with tech toys and such, but he got so frustrated with this unit and its horrible instructions that one day he yanked its cord and slammed it into the garbage can in utter frustration and anger.  In over 20 years of marriage, I've never seen him react that way!  He so wanted to work with it, because it was a gift and wasn't exactly inexpensive, but he finally couldn't deal with it anymore.  He didn't even want to give it to our local charity store to spare them the agony.It also didn't have AM radio!  And it takes up a lot of acreage on the nightstand.So our recommendation is to not buy this product.  We found using seperate charging cords and the iPhone alarm FAR easier!!!",22.0

The monitor is made of cheap plastic, and the back clip/stand will not stand to the test of daily use.  On the positive side, the monitor has a really big screen, but that is where the positive ends.  This product was evidently not engineered with the end user in mind:(1) It lacks a video on/off switch.  If you turn the VOX on, the video will turn off after three minutes of silence, so if you want to check on your sleeping baby you would have to turn the VOX off.  If you leave the VOX off, the video will be on constantly, draining your battery and disrupting your sleep.(2) There is no battery charge meter so that you can track your battery life.(3) The camera has red lights around it that turn on when the infrared is on, potentially disturbing your baby's sleep.(4) If you want to toggle between two cameras, you have to go through the entire 4-camera cycle every time.  The monitor should ""know"" how many cameras you have paired and only cycle through those.(5) Forget about monitoring two babies in different rooms simultaneously.  Unless you stay awake all night and cycle through your different cameras every so often, the camera the monitor will ignore the camera that is not selected.  If you fell asleep with the monitor looking at baby #1 you will never know when baby #2 wakes up crying at 3AM.

15754,15755,"I just ordered my third one in 5 years in my moderate NC climate.  This will give you a good idea of what to expect in terms of durability and value.  Fit is very good on my 48"" deck Husqvarna lawn tractor with some room to spare.  Do find puddles on the seat fairly regularly but don't know exactly why as the rest of the tractor shows zero signs of accumulated condensation, leakage, or rust under any conditions.  Cover RARELY ever comes loose.  In other words, this thing really does its job...except for the minor inconvenience of the puddle on the seat.  I suspect somehow the two rear vents must let in some moisture either in the form of rain or condensation that has only ever accumulated on the seat.  Not a huge deal since the tractor, including the deck, has been well protected for all the years I've been using this exact model of nylon cover.  I only give 4 stars because I think it should be made to last longer than two years with much of that time, in previous years at least, spent in open shade and not in direct sun.  Please note that this past year I did leave the covered tractor in the sun for the whole year and the cover disintegrated after about 1 year.  Thus, this was a ""rush"" order since my tractor is presently unprotected and the shredded old cover is in the trash.  Cover gave way without warning.",32.0

This case seems like it is well made and rugged enough to hopefully last another 15 years like my old one did. There is plenty of room for papers and files, I ditched my laptop bag and just use the one briefcase, which is fine for trips back and forth from the office. This briefcase has plenty of storage room and options, the back side has an opening for easy access to store things you need to get at quickly like your glasses, notepad, or a pack of gum. The inside has 2 different storage areas, this is where I carry papers and documents, and my laptop, still plenty of room if you wanted to carry a copy of ""War and Peace"". There is also a 3rd compartment with a storage area that has a zipper to open and close, perfect for anything you would'nt want to slide out like your check book, IPOD, or cell phone. All of these 3 areas are secured by the flap that opens and closes easily. The only thing missing is the smaller individual storage compartments built into the inside, not enough and not large enough to store other items besides pens or business cards.

Some places will be included and some won't.  Rick does not intend to make his books encyclopedic or entirely comprehensive in their coverage, but his choice of locations (or, rather, his exclusion of locations) in this book can leave a traveler scratching his head.Almost the entire western part of the country, and particularly locations on Lake Geneva, are ignored.  Basel and Geneva are completely absent.  The French-speaking part of the country is very poorly represented.His selection of Alpine villages is also a bit odd, choosing to include Murten and Zermatt which, though lovely, are so small that they can only accommodate a very small number of tourists at any given time.  Authentic?  Certainly.  Practical?  Feasible?  Questionable.  And Rick falling for the touristy glitz of mountain resorts like St. Moritz seems very, well, un-Steves-like!

No flaws noticed.* Although it's a simple design, It's attractive and looks good sink-side.Dislikes* The base is only about 2 ½"" in diameter.  When loaded with a couple of razors, it's not as stable as I'd like.  It does not fall over, but if bumped a little it can.  I wish the base was wider.* At is arrived the top nut would not screw down enough to hold the prongs securely.  They would spin like a pinwheel.

I found that I was rubbing the skin on my thumb raw trying to open it. I put some oil on it and it helped a bit but not much. It has been four days since I received it and I can tell it is becoming easier for it to open with the thumb stud, I guess you can call it a breaking in period, keep in mind I have been opening and closing it every day probably 50 times a day. For the majority of the time I had to use a paper towel to open it because it was cutting my thumb.Other than that problem, this is a beautiful knife and I am sure I will become more happy with the product as it becomes easier to open.Although I wish CRKT wouldn't sell the new and old model for the same price (I feel like the older version should be cheaper) or at the very least let customers know which one they are buying, I am happy with this product and will keep it.",23.0

The delivery was super fast and came in perfect shape. The first flavor I taste is super gingery (which I love) but the aftertaste is a musky kind of bitter taste I can't put my finger on (maybe the stevia?) and I don't like it.

15978,15979,"One man's journey to conquer the physical becomes his emotional deliverance. Francis Slakey begins his quest with a goal in mind - set a record, to be the first man to climb the highest mountain on every continent and to surf every ocean. The challenge he sets out in front of him seems simple at the time: 8 peaks, 4 shorelines, 12 experiences to check off his To Do List. He is driven by his indifference to the world to shrug it off in this independent series of adventures. The world, as it turns out, would have none of that.Slakey is brutally honest about his own agenda, and about how he failed others in following it. At first he failed others, that is. But as he slowly began to open himself up to the amazing experiences surrounding him at every turn, his agenda changed. He changed. He found that it was possible to evolve from someone serving himself to someone serving others. And he didn't do it with a mushy gushy love story, although love was present. He did it by finding that man within himself, the one that always existed. Just as he encourages us to do, simply by telling his story.Inspirational and exciting, follow Francis Slakey as he scales mountains, crosses plains of ice, hunkers down during blizzards, and dodges bullets in an around-the-world adventure that is like none the average joe will ever have. Slakey shares with us his most amazing experiences and his darkest moments and through it all we discover a man we can all learn from. Read it for the adventure, sure, but take away from it the perspective.I received this book for free through the Goodreads First Reads program.",40.0

I found that the soap thickened inside to a hard gel after a few months. Additionally, the soap's scent faded and was replaced with an unpleasant plastic smell. Perhaps some other liquids perform better, but storing Dr. Bronner's soap isn't asking too much. I do like the cap: the cap stays on as well as can be expected, the seal between the bottle and the cap is solid, and the squeeze function keeps it from leaking if the cap is off. I wish it would take less pressure to dispense--I feel like it dispenses more soap than I need--but this is balanced by minimizing leakage.",16.0

I didn't really feel like there were other great options out there and with the ""bundle"" we got from the cable company, it was our best choice. Then along came Ooma.We finally took the plunge and ditched our phone and cable and between the 2, we save over $800 a year. Now, I know that Ooma alone didn't save us that much, but having this option for our phone service really helped in maximizing how much we saved by doing this.

Since that is made of thin plastic it tends to rip pretty easily, pretty soon all of it would be ripped and the only thing connecting the bottom and top half would be a couple of wires. This happened to me within a month or so, but I did use it everyday. Opening up only gives you slightly more bass and I personally feel that its not so great sounding that it would warrant you risking breaking it.Aside from that it still works great and I have had for about a year.

16084,16085,"I really like this lens.  At first I was unimpressed - it did not seem any better than my 28/1.8 (which I also like quite a bit) and I considered returning it.  IS seemed unnecessary, sharpness about the same as the 28/1.8 beyond f/2.8 or so, plus it's bigger than that lens.  But I started to notice things that turned me.First, 35mm focal length simply works better for me than 28mm.  I always preferred the 28mm to my 50mm, but 28mm was always a bit wide - 35mm is perfect.  I doubt I'll reach for either 28 or 50 much anymore, and I may end up selling them.Secondly, the colors this lens produces are really quite pleasing, as is the smoothness of out-of-focus regions.  The 28mm produced some funky results in this area sometimes, depending on the lighting.  Not sure how to describe the issue technically, but I have found no such issue with the 35/2 IS.Third, even though it does improve upon stopping down, the 35/2 IS is sharp wide open.  The 28/1.8 and 50/1.4 are not up to snuff in this regard.  I had rationalized myself around that not being an issue on the older lenses, but it is really quite nice to be able to use a lens wide open and be confident in the results - this is the case with the 35/2 IS.  The wide aperture after all is one of the main reasons to use a prime - it feels great to be able to use it there with confidence!Lastly, IS and I are on speaking terms again.  At first, I actively disliked this feature - I didn't trust it in rapid shooting situations when I didn't think it would have time to settle (turned out to be unfounded), and it just seemed unnecessary at this focal length.  But I have bumped into a few situations so far when it did actually make a difference (late night, relatively long exposures, shooting scenes with moving water, etc).  And I will probably find it very useful if I ever start doing any DSLR video work.  I'd probably like this lens even better if it were made without IS and was $200cheaper and smaller, but I have come to terms with the IS as a useful feature.One other opinion: Canon's new pricing scheme makes sense for this lens.  This is a $500 lens, not an $850 lens.",46.0

Ok no biggie, except now my electronics plugged into the surge protector are not protected.  Had to shut off the electric in the house to pull the broken prong out of the outlet.I never got around to buying a new one, and today the surge protector bit the dust  (11/14/13) less than a year after I bought it.

Don't get me wrong, it's still decent, but I have another brand on another laptop that cost more, but it's definitely a fraction thinner and makes a difference.  The mouse is really lightweight and kind of plastic-y.  I didn't need the mouse.  And the soft external flapped cover is good, but almost unnecessary since most laptop bags have a heavy padded interior.  I guess it can't hurt but it's just more work.

16112,16113,"I originally reviewed this when it was called Morton Pepper Season-All, but the name has been changed (at least on Amazon). Because of the dual language, Amazon is calling it  Morton Pimienta Season-All.  Anyway, here is my review from a couple of years ago.I had been using this Pepper Season-All (under the McCormick label, UPC 052100071336, 5.75 oz.) for many, many years, mostly as my secret ingredient for marinades. Not anymore.About 2 and a half years ago, McCormick sold its Season-All line to Morton, the Pepper Season-All having a UPC of 024600017558, for the 5.75 oz. plastic jar. As I was on my last jar, but hadn't seen the McCormick product in any stores for sometime, I contacted McCormick and they told me Season-All was now under the Morton label. I looked in every grocery I stopped at between Seattle and Spokane and could not find this product anywhere. I asked manager after manager if they were going to get any in, but they checked and said no. I had that UPC memorized, much to their surprise. Go figure.Then, one day at a Wal-Mart, I found it in their spice section and bought the 3 jars they had left. I believe I paid $2.38 per jar. That was the first and ONLY time I have seen it in a store ANYWHERE. When I asked a manager at the same Wal-Mart when they were getting another shipment in, he said he didn't know, as it was out of his control. I asked if I could request they special order it, but he said no. So much for that.It was available on the Morton website (and still is), and even though a 2-pack is reasonable at $7.58, shipping costs are ridiculous. They want $10.44 for FedEx Home delivery (6-10 business days) and $23.12 for FedEx 2nd Day delivery, which shows as arriving in 3 -7 business days. Crazy!Now on Amazon, there a re a few ordering options, but this one takes the cake. $16.99 for a single 5.75.oz. jar, but free Prime Shipping, which I have. Or, even worse, a 6-pack for $89.99 (Free Prime Shipping) or $79.99 ($19.99 Shipping). The latter 2 are actually cheaper overall than the one for $16.99, but you get the picture.What the heck are these guys smoking?UPDATE: Now on Amazon reasonably priced (6-pack) with Prime Shipping!http://www.amazon.com/Morton-Pimienta-Season-All-Seasoned-5-75-Ounce/dp/B00473QU5U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360896118&sr=8-1&keywords=Morton+Pepper+Season-AllIn my search for alternative, I found something that works, but you also need to add course-ground black pepper. McCormick's new Perfect Pinch. It has Roasted Garlic and Red Bell Peppers, no MSG and seems to work well.Bottom Line: If you find any Pepper Season-All in a store, buy it and try it, you won't be dissappointed!",68.0

16114,16115,"I had a hard time rating this, as I really like the piece, but it has a major design flaw. The carving on this is beautiful. It looks higher-end than it is- if you want it to keep looking that way, a low-traffic usage is key. You need to be careful with it, as the finish dings easily. Which brings me to the finish: it's a deep red-brown: think cherry mixed with mahogany. The color looks NOTHING like the picture on my monitor. I was actually pleasantly surprised, since it matches my hardwood floors and a lot of my furniture, but if you are looking for a lighter, more ""golden"" finish, you are going to be disappointed.I bought this to hang as a mantel. I figured it would come with the jagged ""toothy"" hangers that are used to typically hang such things, and well- no. Two keyhole hangers. The main problem here is that the top of the keyhole opening is flush with the underside of the mantel shelf. So the shelf will actually be resting on whatever you use to hang it, screws/nails/etc.-which will hold it up. But if bumped or pulled on, the shelf will probably slip right off the fasteners and the wall. If you're dealing with a brick surface like I am, this is even more problematic, because the shelf will get scratched up, and whatever is on the shelf will probably smash to pieces.If you want this, my advice is to upgrade the wall fasteners to something more secure. If you don't feel like fiddling with it, you may want to find another shelf.",39.0

16129,16130,"The instructions could be better (more detailed and less vague).  However, for the experienced, it's a pleasure.  I've replaced so many toilet floats and flappers, I've lost count..Here are some things that will make the job take WAY more than 5 minutes:....You own a 9-month old Border Collie....You turn off the shutoff valve to the toilet and it starts leaking....You disconnect the supply hose from the current tank filler and the hose is now in pieces... or it starts leaking when you turn the water back on.... You prepare to reconnect the supply hose to the new tank filler and realize you need an adapter or new hose..... In the process of connecting the flapper chain, the flush lever (lift arm) breaks in two from corrosion... or the flush handle breaks off.... NEVER put teflon tape on compression fittings... I see this all the time... and I see leaks all around them..... While installing, you decide the whole toilet really needs to go... or you discover the floor is rotting around the base of the toilet from a bad wax ring, or lack of caulk around the toilet's base..... I could go on and on... and I'm not a plumber... Just be prepared for anything whenever engaging in such fun tasks...  If you're replacing one for a friend, count on at least one of the above items to happen.One more tip... I always see where people have connected the chain to the lift arm incorrectly... this causes two things: the handle has to be held down until the toilet has flushed and/or the flapper often stays open and the toilet ""runs"" forever...Hold down the handle so the lift arm is at its highest point, adjust the length and attach the chain so that the flapper is raised completely, with one or two links of slack... if there's no slack, the flapper can be jerked up so hard that it stays up.",28.0

I scanned as the manual recommended, but got blurry results about 40% of the time.  This was with the unit set to B&W scans at low resolution.  I don't think it was because I was moving the scanner too fast or not in a straight line.  I was scanning single pages from a book.  The photo on Amazon for the scanner shows it being used to scan two pages of a book with the center of the scanner passing along the middle of the binding (where the pages curve in).

16245,16246,"Michael Dirda was for years (decades?) a critic for the Washington Post Book World.  I was aware of this, and also that he was given endless latitude in selecting his topics.  This is the first (and definitely last) book of his that I have read, discovering it at my local library branch sitting on a table.  With a quote from TLS and a reminder that he has a Pulitzer for criticism, it sounded like a promising read.Boy did I loath this book!  I awarded it 2 stars simply because I reserve 1 star for books that are horribly written, which this isn't.  There is nothing technically wrong with the writing.  The author can write a sentence and string several together in a paragraph.  No, I hated this book for the creepy tone and the all-knowing blather.  Call this a self-help book for the intellectually insecure.The assumption behind this book seems to be that there are hordes of people eager to read but utterly clueless about what they should read.  Yes, should read, not want to read.  This is reading as something between castor oil and self-improvement, and reeks of the same white male well-educated superiority that was so popular in the 1950s.  If you liked Adler's Great Books, this is the book for you!  But even Adler limited his all-knowingness to the intellectual realm, instructing the rest of us what we should read.  Not Dirda!  Nope, in addition to endless lists of books we Should Read, he has advice on seemingly all other aspects of life.  ""When we consider the ways we might spend our leisure hours...we shouldn't overlook or neglect hobbies and pets.""  ""Though books can obviously help create a holiday spirit, do not neglect traditional activities.  Listen to Christmas songs on the radio.  Go caroling...""There are over a hundred ""literary"" quotes that the author has lovingly saved up over a lifetime just waiting, apparently, for an opportunity to foist them upon his starved for education readers.

Eventually, I swapped it for a new player.Today, I updated it, hoping that the problem was just with the couple of disks I'd had problems with, but no dice. It simply rejects Blu-rays of the last couple of years, even with the firmware update.It still plays DVDs and old Blu-rays (like Spider-man 3, which came with it I think) but not newer stuff. With Blu-ray players now much cheaper, with fast loading times (this is a dog), and offering streaming services, it's obviously time to junk this, but I'd really expected to be able to give it to my brother, who needs a player with component jacks because he has a pre-HDMI TV.",10.0

16265,16266,"Like one of the earlier reviewers, my experience with the rooCase screen protector (i.e., resistance while writing with the S-pen) was very similar. With this protector, my stylus does not move smoothly due to the friction between the rubber nib and the protector. When writing, the lines are disconnected and sometimes contact is not registered when the stylus touches the screen. This can be quite frustrating and diminishes the value of the benefits of using a digital stylus and, also, having a screen protector (i.e, having to use excessive force to get the stylus to register).    Another issue that I have with the cover, is that when I initially removed it from the package, I noticed that there was a bubble-like indentation (approximately 1-2 mm diameter) in it. Despite this, I decided to still install the protector on my tablet with the hope that the bubble was a temporary anomaly. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The area with the strange indentation is still present and noticeable. Also, when the stylus goes over this area the tablet does not register contact unless I press down quite hard. I am not sure if this was just one item that got by quality control or if this is representative of the quality of rooCASE. Since this was my first time purchasing a rooCASE product, I am definitely a little apprehensive about purchasing future items from this company or recommending them to others.    So, overall, my experience with this product has been quite negative and this is why I have rated it a 2/5.",31.0

I already have two Katadyn filters.. one is a portable pump and the other a gravity fed system. Both are rated for a max of 40,000 gallons if I remember correctly. Those two filters would now cost about $400. They are still excellent filters systems. But for size, price  AND volume these Sawyer Filters can not be beat. I think this new filter technology will forever change the industry.. Now, there are many reviews of how these filters performed in actual situations. Some say they have not worked up to their needs. I cannot comment on how they work for camping etc. These comments of those who have used them, are factors to be taken into consideration according to your needs. In the right conditions and set up, these filters could literally last a lifetime. Since CLEAN / Purified WATER is one of the critical needs for survival, These filters should be part of everyone's emergency preparations.Please note - There are Sawyer ""Filters"" for bacteria/ parasites and ""Purifiers"" which also will filter out virus'.  I returned the ""Point One"" FILTER system, because I wanted the ""Point Zero Two"" viral protection as well. My thinking is, with new strains of virus' emerging all the time, this is just an added layer of ""insurance""..",53.0

16279,16280,"I tested these ear plugs against two other brands that I own and use. I compared them against the Etymotic Research ER20's and the Downbeats Resuable Plugs. All of them are available on Amazon.com.These plugs won the test, but only by a slim margin over the Downbeats.Fit and handling- Dubs won!I never liked the way the Etymotics fit or felt. The tri-rib design always bothered me when I had them in and the plastic stem protrudes quite a bit. The Downbeats fit much better but have a tiny stem that's difficult to grasp. However once they are in- they are unobtrusive. The DUBS Acoustic Filters have a moderate sized speaker-looking contraption at the end that you can hold them by. Not only do they look cool, but they are easy to put in and take out. The DUBS were comfortable to have in my ears for a couple of hours without any issue. So the DUBS won this part of the competition hands down- easy to handle and wear.Sound Quality- The DUBS tied the Downbeats in this category.They both allowed for a relatively full spectrum of sound to pass through to my ears. With that being said- all plug will increase the bass effect of the music you're listening to. I don't believe there's much of a way around that. They both cut down the intensity (decibels) enough for live music without muffling it like foam plugs will. If you're experiencing extremely loud sound, the foam plugs or headphones are still the way to go. But for a live rock concert these worked for me. The Etymotics did cut down more decibels when positioned just right. Sound quality was also good with them. But the fit left something to be desired as mentioned above.Packaging- Downbeats was the winner here.The DUBS had the slickest packaging out of all three. A little plastic case, rectangular in shape, that holds each plug in it's own hole. The downside is that if you're fumbling with it in minimal light, it can be a hassle. Downbeats are packaged loose ina little metal cylinder with a key ring. This is extremely convenient and secure. It's slightly larger in size than the DUBS packaging, but not too big to have in your pocket. The top simply screws off. The Etymotics come in a semi-soft plastic pouch that seals shut. It's convenient, but not crush proof. In all, I prefer the packaging of the Downbeats and will thus put my DUBS in that nifty little blue metal holder that the Downbeats came with!The overall winner....DUBS! If the packaging were more convenient, they'd be perfect.",78.0

I bought this guitar because I wanted something different from my dreadnaught, and to have something that I didn't have to humidify.  I had one problem.  There was a buzz on the top string at the 12th fret.  Fortunately for me, I have a friend who is a luthier, and after some work to the frets, it sounds great!  Also I wasn't a fan of the stock strings, so I changed them out for my favorites (Elixir nano-webs), and found it playing better after that as well.

But this has since been corrected. It is 37"" high WITH the stand...the stand adds 2"" to the height - and you definitely need the stand. I bought it for an indoor window I have in my home and it barely fits...but still awesome.Assembling the model is a little bit of work.

I would suggest pouring a glass of wine or hot tea and make it a date night with your loved one when putting this together!I used photos from the Amazon.com site on my iPad when assembling the boat.

The iPad app only shows the photos provided by the seller...but if you go to www.amazon.com with a browser, you can see more photos. The model comes with just a single sheet of paper as the instructions. The most important thing is to not allow the rigging lines to become tangled when removing it from the box! It is tempting to pull everything out before reading the assembling instructions but be careful when doing so. The lines have small hooks on them and it is easy to tangle things up.Overall it is a beautiful display with it's rich, navy colored body and huge sails.

16427,16428,"There is no other solution that enables you to do live broadcast video streaming to the web for under $500, but be prepared to deal with many shortcomings:1. Battery performance is BAD. A set of good rechargeable AA batteries barely makes it an hour or so, so you'll want to have it plugged into an external power source if shooting a lengthier event... if you have to change batteries mid-shooting, it takes a solid 2 minutes to swap and reboot and rejoin your broadcast.2. 4G modem support is BAD. They list some models, and we went with a supposedly supported Verizon model, but it wouldn't connect as a 4G modem. And tech support is basically non-existent. There's not even a user's manual... It's a figure-it-out-as-you-go product that is mostly easy, but quirky. What DID work reliably, however, was setting up a Verizon mobile hotspot and having the Broadcaster connect to the 4G modem over WiFi.3. Small display... if your Livestream events all start with the same beginning words, you won't be able to see which one you want to select when setting up your stream, so it forces bad naming behavior on your events.But once up and running with a WiFi connection, and with adequate power, it works as hoped for, and at our school, we can now live stream video events from out on our sports fields and other areas where we don't have access to the network.",24.0

16432,16433,"What I love: The kibble is really small, the ingredients are good, the nutrition is complete, it works for sensitive tummies, and my dogs like it. I have four dogs, two of them are as old as dirt. OK, actually they are 16 (Milton) and 18 (Max). Milton has no teeth and Max has no front teeth. The Vet said dogs use teeth to bite and tear, not to grind food to mush (like we do) and that even without teeth they may like to each crunchy food. She was right... they actually prefer it because it's easier for them to pick up. They are Doxies and they have long noses, but short jaws. This is a problem because the wet food sticks to their bowls and they can't get it into their mouths, and it's like watching a dog try to eat peanut butter. (OK, I know that can be totally funny and I'll admit to laughing at my lab after giving her peanut butter. But it's only funny when it's a treat, not when they are really hungry.) OK, all that to tell you this kibble is perfectly small. We used to buy regular food and smash it with a meat tenderizer, (yep, that's a hassle) but this is small enough as is. They also have sensitive tummies, but this stuff never makes them barf. And, they both continue to get excellent blood test results, so I think this food does provide good nutrition for them. They have been eating Nutro for years, and they are hella old... so that in itself is a good reason to buy this food.",44.0

16434,16435,"I love playing MMH6 and I can go hours at a stretch without any issues...until the game freezes!  The sad part about the freezes is that is it usually after just winning a close battle and mostly when I have forgotten to save the game right before the battle (auto-save every day is nice; but, not when I have to do all the things I did up until the freeze all over again).Even worse, in the months since I have bought this game and been playing it, I have scoured the internet almost every time it freezes to see if there is any resolution or if Ubisoft is even paying attention to the mountain of complaints and posts about the freezes (primarily in town screens and with the NVIDIA cards/drivers of which I have dual GTX670s with the latest video drivers).  There is minimal to no response or reaction from Ubisoft nor has there been a fix.  In other words, Ubisoft is ignoring their customers and choosing to work on their expansion that has now been delayed until May 2013 (perhaps to finally fix the freeze issues...like we all want to wait that long).So, overall, I give the game a 5/5 for the fun that it is and only a 3/5 overall because of the bugginess and lack of response/support from Ubisoft to fix the freeze bug while raking in the cash on sales of this and other games!BTW: As for the DRM debate; I don't have a problem with DRM as long as I have the option/ability to play offline with a preference towards also being able to install and activate offline; though, as one reviewer pointed out, it isn't that big a deal to need to install and activate online and then be able to play offline in this age of near mandatory internet connectivity.",18.0

We don't grind salt at our house so I don't need a white salt grinder.  Grinders for salt and pepper are made differently. Pepper grinders need a metal grinder for the harder peppercorns, while salt grinders can use other materials. The black and white color scheme obviously makes it easier to identify what you are about to grind, salt or pepper.  The ads on Amazon don't offer a white peppermill. But in a phone call to the manufacturer I learned that they are happy to put the pepper grinding mechanism into a white shell. At no extra charge!  I ordered the white mill on Thursday and the Post Office delivered it on Monday.  The thumbscrew on the bottom makes it easy to adjust the grind from fine powder to a coarse grind.  I feel no need to repeat the detailed comments from other reviewers that you've already read. I just wanted you to know that you can get the peppermill in white, if you so desire.

16510,16511,"First off let me start by saying that the 5 stars is not attributed to the quality of the diamond but that they are as described. Quality diamonds are expensive... <- I hope most people know that: anyway. . .For all the people who reviewed the item as one star, they either have no idea what a clarity scale is or do not bother to read the stone specifications. These are listed as having a clarity of I2-I3. These grades are the lowest possible diamond clarity a certified stone can receive. JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE CERTIFIED does not mean they are quality diamonds. If they were quality, they would sell for thousands not hundreds. Amazon is great but it cannot perform miraculous price reductions.EXPECT these diamonds to be cloudy, to have fissures (cracks) , carbon specs and carbon feathers. From a distance they will look great. The color specifications listed are decent at faint yellow, almost undetectable with the naked eye.If you are looking to buy real diamonds and cannot afford quality , these are your stones. If your trying to pass these off as expensive to save a buck, I hope she doesn't look too close or . . . Look for a diamond with a clarity of VS1 ... Maybe VS2 or better.",28.0

First of all, the outer ""wings"" are weighted (more on this in a minute) and very comfy in both directions - a nice feature when cranking a head down tight to seat it.  Second, when you remove the lanyard to use it, there is a knurled knob-like part that sticks up above the key.  Once tension rods are loose (either during removal or installation), you can give it a spin between your fingers and make fast work of the rod (the weighted wings give it a little inertia to keep it spinning).  Third, the little colored rubber nubs (supplied) are handy in TWO ways: a) by using different colors it can assist in keeping track of revolutions, and b) they're perfect for tapping near the edge for lug tuning.  The lanyard is an added bonus for keeping track of the key, either around your neck or hanging off one of the floor tom tension rods.

16584,16585,"Author Paul Theroux is highly acclaimed and his books have caught my eye on many occasions, especially his travel stories in Asia. When this was available via the Vine Program, I was happy to get a free taste. I'm not sure whether this book is indicative of his style or not, but if so, I'm unlikely to read any of his other work. Perhaps the many review references to The Heart of Darkness, a novel I'm in the minority in disliking, should've been a clue.The Lower River is a sad, terse, and largely empty tale of an older man wanting to go back to a time in his life he's tenaciously clung to as the greatest period of a life lived through the rear view mirror. It isn't hard to figure out how this will go, and worse yet, Theroux didn't surprise me. I followed depressed old Ellis Hock back to Africa and read as things proceeded exactly as I imagined, like watching a slow motion car crash, or perhaps more appropriately, a slow motion snake bite.The writing was emotionally flat and not nearly as revelatory as I think a story such as this begs to be. Hock has lived his life holding a brief but highly idealized period of his life in a state of suspension, amazingly incapable of envisioning that it would have changed dramatically in forty years. Even with this particular area of Africa being extremely remote, it's hard to imagine someone being so naïve as to think he could return to a place after four decades and pick up where he left off. Sadder still, it would seem that he failed to completely live in the everyday world of his life, preferring instead to mentally wander back to the village he cherished so much. One wonders what he might've made of his life post-Africa had he invested a fraction of the enthusiasm into said life that he's held exclusively for Malawi.I understand that Theroux is making larger points about the issue of Africa's poverty and trying to paint a very different picture than the one the charity folks would like us tosee.  To that end the author describes quite well Hock's creeping dread and the crushing despair that breeds resignation for some, malevolence in others. Beyond this, the characters were limited in depth, descriptions were often repetitive, and there was a sense of not knowing where to go with the story. Had Theroux fashioned this into a sad short story reflection on the folly of living in the past, I'd have liked it more because the second half seemed like a deliberate addition to try and add some suspense. To that end, it didn't work. The Lower River was a disappointment because it was neither entertaining nor engaging for me.  2.5 stars.",44.0

16598,16599,"Given its modest price, purchased this just to determine whether it could hold camera/binoculars more securely when trekking over difficult terrain (most recently, Patagonia) than using a standard strap (a heretofore favorite being the Op/Tec version long enough to allow the camera to swing on one side). The harness won out every day and was MUCH easier on shoulders and, even with elastic straps, minimized movement and resultant need to compensate when navigating uneven ground. Speaking of elastic, my camera, a relatively heavy Nikon D300 plus 18-300 lens (the heavier version) did cause significant stretching, but adjusting the straps compensated fully and still allowed full range of motion from chest to eye level. Best of all, even after a long day, I had forgotten just how heavy the camera/lens really really was. Finally, the Op/Tech connector system allows one to mix and match various devices for ease of handling and safety.Cannot recommend highly enough.",16.0

16601,16602,"I love this item! It's great being able to use my own choice in my Vue machine when I want.I was a little hesitant at first considering a friend of mine had tried similar items for his Platinum Keurig brewer and said the coffee always seemed weak. Thankfully that is not the case here (there is always the strong option on the Vue brewer if you need it even stronger).As of writing this review I believe this is the only product out there that fulfills this function for the Vue brewer. Luckily this item is quality built and designed very well. Their customer service responds quickly and was very helpful regarding my inquiries. The piano hinge is very strong and the plastic the cup is made of is thick, so I believe it will last a long time. The cup and filter are easy to clean, although at a while the file does start to darken with coffee oils, although they informed me that this can be easily taken care of with distilled white vinegar and a soft toothbrush. The decaflow head does distribute water evenly. This item also works well with loose leaf tea and I have used tea bags with great success as well.The only complaint I have is that you must make sure the lid is compressed as possible, and must be careful when closing and opening the Vue machine. The cup can and will slide, which if not careful when will damage the needle due to the cup sliding out into the needles path. I'm not sure if they could have designed a solution to this problem due the design of the machine's horizontal brewing style.UPDATE July 9th, 2013: After attempting to clean off some of the coffee that stains/builds up on the gold screen after a while following the instructions I received after making an inquiry (see review above) some of the gold plating has come off. I was extremely gentle with the soft toothbrush after letting it soak in distilled white vinegar overnight. I even tried using the pads of my fingers very lightly which yielded in the sameresult unfortunately.I still believe this product is worth purchasing if you want to use your own coffee with the Vue machine as it fulfills its function very well....Just be aware of the couple downsides with this product as well.",46.0

16620,16621,"Game is great... Amazon, not so much. Buyer beware that Amazon is misleading. I ordered 2 copies of this game for different people as Christmas presents. As a pre-order promotion Amazon was offering a game code that would unlock additional game content. After the order was shipped I received 2 games but only one game code. Not really paying much attention to it (my fault) I printed out the game code and attached it inside the wrapped presents not noticing that there was only one code (in spite of the fact I bought and paid for 2 games). Upon discovering this (after) the boys (2 nephews) had opened their Christmas presents I immediately felt like a heal because one game code can not be used twice; hence one gets the upgrade one does not. On Christmas day (after they boys had opened their gifts (together) the problem was immediately obvious. So, I contacted Amazon asking for help but was informed that only one code per customer could be issued no matter how many games you ordered. WTF? What kind of BS is that? Where is the logic? With this experience I want to share with everyone that if you need to order multiple copies of the same game expecting to receive the same pre-order benefits don't do it with Amazon. Order yours and have others order additional games for you if you are going to buy from Amazon; or just buy from someone else. After contacting Amazon I have been told I can send any unopened games back... Like that is even an option. Amazon customer relations and marketing needs an enema. Now I have 2 little boys disappointed on Christmas day because if I give to one I can't give to the other.

16626,16627,"I bought one of these as a gift a few years ago and was really impressed with the quality. I bought two more of these recently, one black one brown. They are a total disappointment. Both appear to be man made material, not at all the quality of the first one I purchased. If there is any actual leather, it is a very thin layer over cheap man-made material. They not only look cheap, but they feel worse. The color is off and it doesn't even feel good for fake leather. The black one has threads hanging off of several edges that are clearly man-made (there's no stitching on these). Unfortunately I didn't inspect them when I received them, 30 days elapsed and I can't return them. They're so disappointing that I don't even want to keep them as spares no matter how little I paid for them. I hate to just throw them away, but I'd be embarrassed to give them to anyone.   Original review - 1st purchase: This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back. At full price of 16.99, it is a solid deal. Any lower, and it is a steal. Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different. Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for. This one appears to be an exception to that rule. But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more. If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis. If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet. Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow).",63.0

Bought it in 2008 and had to have battery replaced in 2011. Now have to have battery replaced again (March, 2015), and decided to have TAG do it. So I sent to TAG for estimate, which cost me $35 insured through UPS. At first cheapest service they would offer that includes battery replacement was $95. Ouch! Then was told watch needed complete overhaul at $170. So that's $205 to replace the battery!!!!!!! Probably hadn't worn it 100 times since I've owned it (special occasions only), and it is in pristine condition. You can get the battery replaced anywhere, but if you want gaskets replaced, reputable jewelers will send it to TAG and probably charge you a premium for their time. IMHO, this is a BIG rip off by TAG's aftermarket service group in NJ. Definitely not going to buy another TAG for sure.

It is fast-paced, the author has a personal stake in this story, which is really two stories, and the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm comes through when he pieces together his well-researched clues to tell the tale of his disappearing great-uncle and the history of his great-uncle's employer, the L.R. Steel Company.  Dyer found out where and when Great Uncle Clayton disappeared and reappeared but answers to the mystery of Clayton's behavior are most likely contained within the rapid rise and fall of the L. R. Steel Company and its founder, Leonard Rambler Steel.For history buffs, the book is filled with photos and articles mostly from the early 1920's.

I currently am an Art major, and my latest medium of choice is kiln-formed glass (you design glass and fire it in a kiln). Anyone knows that glass can be a somewhat difficult subject matter to photograph considering the reflecting and transmitting of light, especially dichroic glass. I currently sell my glass online, and I'm also throughout my schooling, building a portfolio. I really needed a decent camera to capture the depth, different textures and vibrant colors. So I bought a Nikon d5100 and it came with an 18-55mm lens. Great! Still wasn't grasping the textures and layers while photographing at the closest possible distance the lens will allow... Anyway, I have found that for what I need, the 30mm extension tube was more than enough magnification, in fact it was too much. The 20mm hits the spot. It allows my camera to capture every ripple and crinkel in the textures glass, while using AF as well. With the 30mm the AF did not want to perform which was fine I just switched it to manual. The 20mm worked great and I was able to get just inches away from the subject matter. This replaces my need for a macro lens and does the job nicely.

It does have a tendency to move a little on the higher speeds, but I have it on a granite counter top sitting on a small towel (makes it easier to move on the granite counter top).

I read the reviews on this and a couple others a number of times, finally threw caution to the wind and bought these. Well, it doesn't come close to performing like the original. Install was fine, except for the error messages that plagued me for almost a week, that it wasn't installed right. I'm not dummy and having done this for years, I know there is only one way they go in all the way to the test page. It's not rocket science. The pages will only print yellow for color, and the black isn't dark, it's light when it prints. Finally, while I can print say, a recipe off a website (albiet with a light black result)? It will not print anything off MS Word 2007. So, of course it being the end of a school year, my kids had to put their papers to stick and run to a friend's house or early to school to print out their reports. No, I haven't replaced it with the original ink yet, as school is out and I can make due (I hope) through the summer. But believe me, I won't make this mistake again.

I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card ([[ASIN:B00840353W Elgato Game Capture HD (10025010)]]) or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture.Overall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).I haven't had the chance to try 3D yet to see if it works, maybe when I do I'll come back and update the review.",14.0

I have the plastic, because he outgrew the curious stage and doesn't nibble/bite on anything (not power cords, not his cage, mainly just books when he's playing and of course his wooden chews inside his cage). Regardless, when I initially bought this, he WAS chewing on plastic, so I wanted something glass that could hang on his old cage, on the outside (I still hang this on the outside, because he does do a lot of jumping around, and I don't want him dislodging it).I don't use anything extra to secure the bottle. I use the coil only, and the bottom part rests in-between the wires. It's never once been knocked down. I had the smaller bottle at first, and it DID have issues dispensing water, but I always mark the water line with new bottles and check back within a few hours to see that it's significantly lower, so I knew right away of the issue. The person at Petsmart suggested the bigger bottle. It didn't have this issue. I could see the bubbles immediately when my chinchilla drank.After about a year, it started leaking. I think this is due to me fiddling too much with the pipe that dispenses the later (the part the animal drinks out of and the part that screws in are separate parts). I got a new one. And that's the one I've had ever since. I clean it with a pipe cleaner regularly and a mild soap/water solution, because the inside of the bottle can get a little gross, even if it's glass. That's precisely the reason I bought him a new bottle. The old one, after a fewyears, was just a little too gross.And this one works fine as well. So here are my suggestions after years of ownership:1. Buy the big bottle.2. Still mark the water line with a sharpie or something to see that it goes down.3. Clean the inside regularly.",64.0

It brewed my coffee pretty slowly right out of the box and only got worse pretty quickly.After becoming painfully slow at brewing, I learned that coffee makers need to be cleaned with a 50/50 mix of water and vinegar to keep clean. After researching various treatment methods, I settled on one and cleaned it. Bad idea, apparently. water stopped flowing completely. I assumed this was calcium buildup and dumped all the debris out and tried again. Also a bad idea. Within an hour, it popped loudly a few times and I came back to a mess of water and vinegar leaking out of the bottom. One of the hoses became disconnected and broke one of the plastic cuffs.This thing has sucked since I got it, but I'm giving it 2 stars because the water in my area is pretty hard - and I guess I'm partially to blame for not cleaning it every month.Pros:-Built in filter so you don't have to buy disposable ones.-Programming works well.-Unplugging it for a short time keeps the clock working, very handy when you shuffle your stuff around.Cons:-Died after 5 months.-Blue light is extremely freaking bright to the point where I have to face it a certain direction away from my bedroom.

I actually quit buying from Griots for over a year because they shipped me a can and during transit part of the product spilled out due to the lid coming off.  When I called their ""world famous we want everyone happy"" customer service line to request a new can, the dipshot CSR said that they could not replace the product because it wasn't their fault.  He was kind enough to suggest that I scrape up all of the loose wax in the box and microwave it so it would liquefy, then pour it back into the can.  Yeah buddy, why don't you have Richard Griot come over and do that for me.2.  True to their record, no one ships slower than Griots, causing Amazon to miss their committed delivery date.  Amazon needs to threaten them with dropping their products if they don't make the ship date.  The product didn't even get to the shipper for two days.  Unacceptable.  The advantage of buying through Amazon is that you avoid Griot's ridiculous shipping charges.",41.0

16890,16891,"The 2013 Asus Nexus 7 is absolutely awesome when it works.Unfortunately, it is also very fragile. I bought one right before a trip and was loving it until 2/3 of the digitizer went intermittent then quit working. After looking at it under various lighting conditions while it was off, I could see a hair line crack in the display/digitzer stack. The fracture was not visible with the display on. You could not feel it on the surface. The digitizer worked on the narrow side of the crack and not on the other two thirds of the screen.This device is too fragile. The chassis flexes easily and I believe this is what allows the display to flex enough to break the digitizer. I feel like this product is going to have major issues because it is small enough to fit in a pocket like a large cell phone and based on the amount of flex in the chassis, this is the kiss of death for a nexus 7. For anyone considering buying a 2013 Nexus 7, put it in a nice fat rigid case immediately and never, never subject it to any flex.I think Asus should take a look at an a Samsung note 2. I have carried one for a year and not been nearly as careful, and it is holding up fine, granted it is smaller, but the 2013 nexus 7 lasted 3 days and the repair cost (165.00 for a screen that you install) The repair cost is too expensive to make sense and turns an awesome device into land fill fodder. What sucks is that I feel responsible for breaking it although it was never dropped or handled roughly, and from the posts around the web, I can tell that it is a waste of time to try to get Asus to stand behind their product even though it is three days old.As much as I hate to sound like a Apple fan boy, at least you can fix an ipad digitizer for 30 bucks if you are willing to burn an hour or two.

16904,16905,"Over all the desk looks good.  However it is a 'knock-down' piece of furniture meaning some assembly is required.  That being said, some of the washers were missing from the assembly package but we didn't find this out until all the packaging (and it is a lot, it is boxed and crated so you have to saw into it to get the desk out rendering it useless for returning) had been removed.  So we proceeded to assemble it without the missing washers.After getting the desk together, we needed to attach the lip/facing to the drop down center drawer (which already came assembled by the manufacturer).  It required a very simple task of attaching screws to a hinge that was attached to the center drawer.  Once attached, we inserted the drawer on to the pre-existing glides in the sides of the desk.  The center drop down drawer did not close properly, it easily pinches your fingers if you are not careful and it does not line up at the edge of the drawer lip as do the drawers to the left and right of it.I contacted the seller-Cymax and their solution was for me to return it which requires taking it apart, and then paying to have it repackaged, (the desk is large and weighs 105lbs) and then paying to ship it back.  So all total my costs would have been roughly $200.00 - $250.00 to ship back a $350.00 desk.  They offered no assistance via phone as to how I might adjust/fix the center drawer so it would close properly... ""Just ship it back and we'll give you a refund."" was their attitude.

16945,16946,"I ordered the Luna Fauna Koi as a gift for my daughter, who's been taking lessons for more than a year now and is ready to step up from her 3/4 size Luna Safari Muse Mahogany travel guitar.Out of the box, this guitar is quite lovely.  The shining black lacquer is gorgeous, and the koi design truly stands out.  There is additional abalone inlay around the sound hole, in the lunar phases on the neck, and the Luna name on the headstock.  It's a folk-style guitar with a cutaway for higher notes, fairly small in body if you're comparing to the average dreadnaught.  I did buy this for a 10 year old girl, and liked that Luna caters to those with smaller hands.  According to the manufacturer, the top is select spruce, with mahogany sides and back.  Fretboard and bridge are mahogany, with plastic nut and saddle.  There is a preamp in the bottom, with battery installed, and a tuner in the side.  This is helpful to me, as she's already lost her clip-on tuner.We bought two guitars to compare, and one will go back.  The Luna has a brighter sound, very lively.  There's an unfortunate buzz when you try to play too loud, though, the strings just keep vibrating against the frets.  Because of this, its volume range is less than the other guitar, a Takamine New Yorker body style.  It does have a good feel, is comfortable to hold, and is lightweight for its size.I should note that there is glue visible at some of the joints.  Also be aware that this has only one strap button.  You'll either need an acoustic strap, or install another button.  Lastly, her teacher wants to adjust the truss rod, saying it's too bowed backwards.  I have a few doubts about the quality of this guitar, will it hold up for years and years?Overall, my initial impression is that this would be a fine guitar for a beginner or intermediate player, someone who doesn't have much of a musical ear yet.  After two weeks or tryout, I had to edit my review down to 3 stars.  It certainly has the looks to keep a young student interested, and the electric option may open another door for her down the road.  But in terms of sound, it just can't compare to the other one.  She really wants to keep the Luna, and we want the Takamine.  Mommy may just have to put her foot down.",67.0

Not a bad feature if you have Plex and local files.Cons:- Requires a thumbdrive to download additional Blu-ray content. Having that sticking out of the front is a magnet for kids, and it wouldn't have cost more than a few bucks to build-in some storage for it.- VERY flaky network connections.

For a while there, people were concerned that she had toned down the sex to the point that she was losing a big part of what constituted her stories. Well, friends, I don't know if this is the first book where the trend reverses, but the sex is here.I realize this is a bit like saying that you read Playboy for the articles - highly suspect - but I don't really care whether my romances have explicit sex in them or not. I generally skim or skip when the action gets too hot and heavy. (If I want erotica, I know where to find it.) I read Showalter because she manages somehow to go really super dark in her plots - hyper-violence! epic battles of good vs. evil! superbeings clashing over world-shattering stakes! - while still being really whimsical. Sometimes maybe a little on the verge of too much, maybe. The women in this book sounded to me like a Cosmo quorum. But it's still playful and breezy and good-spirited and leavens the darkness nicely. Fantasy-horror-rom-com.Sometimes I have a problem with Showalter's world building. She's been at it so long and has built such an amazing canon that I'm constantly stumbling over plots and people I don't remember or just don't know, and I've run into a book or two where I felt sidelined by subplots or set-up for a future book. That wasn't an issue at all in Burning Dawn. There were references to the broader mythos and, yes, some groundwork, but it never distracted from the main story or left me confused.Anyhoodle, if you pant over alpha men and flippant women with a heart of gold, if your stomach doesn't churn when people are disemboweled or beheaded in fiction (or if you can push past it), if you can handle a story that is simultaneously grim and bouncy, AND if you do not shy at some pretty explicit shenanigans between (and above and nowhere near) the sheets, this could be the book for you.Fun times.

The 3 pin sight is usable - but this bow does not come with a peep. And a heads up, many of the draw length or weight adjustments will require a bow press and a qualified individual, most in fact.

The sound of the wheels on the cracks in the concrete make her go crazy and she barks and even tries to lunge at the rider. NOT OKAY. I've had to use it a few times already and it really helps to snap her out of her frenzy. As soon as I spot a skateboarder coming, I stay calm and prepare to click as soon as she shows signs that she's spotted the skateboard, then I give her a command to sit and stay. Once it has passed I make her keep sitting and not move until she is calm like nothing happened. So far this has worked, I hope she will eventually learn to ignore skateboarders without needing the clicker.I've also started using it to help train her to not jump on me when I walk in the door, which is another big problem. This hasn't been as successful as with the skateboard situation.

17068,17069,"[[VIDEOID:7143cf5abbabc0c24dcc19d5e9aea7f4]] The Lefun Wireless IP 720P HD Wifi Camera is an easy user friendly monitoring camera that anyone can learn to use. That fact alone is my favorite feature about this camera. Granted there are tons of great features to talk about and we will get into that through this review; but I want to point out that this camera can be used for the home or business and is simple to setup. Some ideas or ways you can use this camera is as a security camera, baby monitor, intercom system, and workshop monitor.  As I have mentioned this camera is easy to setup and the box includes everything you need to get going. First plug in the Ethernet and power cables, then get your phone or tablet ready. The box has three qr codes that are for the iOS and Android apps along with the camera id and password. Once you download the app all you have left to do is create an account and add the camera. To add the camera select settings option on the top right side of the app, scroll down, and press ""Add device."" Then press the qr code button, scan the small qr code on the box or bottom of the camera, type in the password, and follow any other prompts it pops up. That's all there is too it to set it up initially.  The rest of the settings are preferences such as resolution, activating alarms, and other settings such as sensitivity. Once you get all your preferences selected it's time to mess around and discover everything the camera can do. Some of the features I like the most is the rotating head that you can control from your app and the alerts.  The only problem I had with the camera was not actually the camera's fault. I was not able to setup the camera using WiFi and that's because my Apple router does not have a WPS button to sync between the camera and router. However, I am able to connect the camera to my WiFi if I unplug the Ethernet cable and leave it connected to the power source. I would love to have the camera apart from my router, but until I get something else I will have to use it while tethered to the router.  Other than the non-wireless setup I would like to have, there are no complaints from me at all. This is a quality IP camera that anyone can use.",51.0

17091,17092,"Previous Jawbone Up user here. I am someone who doesn't go to the gym to work out because of my schedule. Everyday I'm running to/from classes, work, meetings, etc. I like that a fitness device can track how many steps I've taken in a day and how many miles I've traveled throughout the day.I went back and forth for nearly two weeks trying to decide between the Fitbit One and the Fitbit Zip. I liked that the Zip was cheaper and did the basic functions (pedometer, distance) that I needed. I also liked that it was smaller. Yet I went with the One because I am actually interested in the sleep tracking function.I read many reviews and surfed through countless forums/debates on which device was better and why people liked one or the other more. Based on reviews from other women, I was worried that the Fitbit One would be more uncomfortable and inconvenient to wear simply because it's a little bit larger than the Fitbit Zip. I've had the One for nearly a month now and I absolutely LOVE the size of it. It clips perfectly on the fabric in between my bra (regular bra, not a sports bra). I face the LCD screen towards my chest and the clip faces front. I choose to do that just because I'm paranoid and feel like the actual device is more secure this way. Also, the battery life of the One is great! I can go two weeks until I need to charge it again.Why did I return the Jawbone Up band and stick with Fitbit One? Funny you ask! I actually loved the design of the Up band but I hated that I had to plug it into my phone every time I wanted to sync my data. I also wear a watch everyday on my non-dominant hand and I didn't like wearing too much on my wrist.I would definitely recommend the Fitbit One to anyone! I also LOVE that the MyFitnessPal app syncs with the Fitbit app! Kudos to you Fitbit, you guys know what you're doing...and you're doing it right.",58.0

I like the options to screw over my fellow gamers and this Mario party's only screw you option is if you play bowser party and then who ever plays bowser pretty much gets to screw everyone...which is fun the first time, but after a few rounds the 6 repetitive mini games get old.

Small thing but when shaping some of the spilled over stain made a mess when I started shaping for retention.Middle of the Road:This holster requires a retention screw to out of the box retain the SR9 properly, which it does not have and really can not have as there isn't a reliable space to place it. I'd rather have it compact and be without this.Leather is not stiff enough to provide the retention of a more expensive holster, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was, but it is worth mentioning that for double the money you would be able to hang upside down and still retain the pistol. You can not do that with this model.Pro:The leather is above average quality as far as this price range.

17274,17275,"So first I should probably explain why I got it and what I expected from it.  I just built a small Media PC to run Plex on for streaming my local videos to a TV.  I just needed something that would allow me control plex, be small enough to fit on an arm rest, and be easy for non techs to understand and use as others in my house would need to use it.It has met those needs and more.  I use the D-pad arrangement to quickly scroll around in Plex.  Enter key starts, space will pause, S key for subtitles.  Wonderful.  The times something goes wrong and I need to quickly Ctrl-alt-delte, there is a function key for that.  The backlight is a nice feature and very useful for dark rooms, although I wish it would stay on a little longer than it does.  The touch pad is a great feature that I use to quickly get around the screen if I need to perform updates or relaunch Plex.I'm about 12 feet away from my TV and the computer this is plugged into and have very little issue using it like I do.  Now I will say that the few times where I am trying to type something, I will have to hit a key more than once being at this distance.  Also, when I hold it and cover the entire left side, that seems to interfere with the transmitter but not to any degree that I am bothered by it.For a low cost way to control my MediaPC boxes, this is absolutely what I was wanting.  I've purchased another and am looking to get a third for my next Media PC box.  If I was looking to do any amount of data entry from 12' away I would have to find a different device.  But as this does what I wanted for a very affordable price I'm happy to give it 5 stars.",39.0
17275,17276,"The good news is that this was a book I couldn't put down, even after the hand cramps started from holding the Kindle for so long.  The bad news is if you want to read a book that will scare the actual sleep from you, you're best off reading Neil Gaiman's ""The Ocean at the End of the Lane.""""Doctor Sleep"" is not a bad book.  It's actually one of King's better books, but ranks below his most recent works ""Joyland"" and ""11/22/63.""The books fails in an area that you would not expect from King.  It's not long enough.  The most interesting part of the book is the beginning.  The scariest part of the book is the beginning.  Danny's early days following what happened at the Overlook are far more interesting than anything else and the least developed.  How does one survive something as horrifying as what happened to the young Danny?It was King himself, I believe, who once said that a book is only as good as its villain.  And while the concept of psychic vampires is interesting, the characters themselves are rather weak and hamstrung quite easily.How was the True Knot formed?  Who are these people?  Who was Rose?  How did she come to be?  Where is her origin story?  We are treated in the beginning to the origin story of one the members and then that character is barely seen for the rest of the book.Again, this was not a bad book.  If it were not by King, I might have rated it higher, but I've come to expect more from him.  In the end he didn't let down Danny completely, but he could have done better by him.",48.0

17283,17284,"This watch has a lot of nice features.  The date is displayed on a white background, smoothly tucked between the 4 and 5 o'clock hour markers.  The watch hacks when setting allowing you to precisely set the seconds.  The chronograph seconds hand smoothly sweeps at 5 ticks per second.  The lume is bright and easy to read in the dark.Light blue accents on the chrono second hand and on the chapter ring at 12, 3, 6, and 9 add a pleasant dash of color.  The lume applied to the hour markers also has a slight blue tinge.  The only criticism of the watch face is that the markers on the running seconds do not match precisely with each tick of the second hand.The weakest part of the watch is the bracelet.  The bracelet makes a jangly sound when you move your wrist due to the hollow end links.  The clasp is of good quality and clicks securely closed.  The bracelet does not have half-links, but the clasp has two micro-adjust settings allowing you to fine tune the fit of the bracelet.

If you use the correct size phillips screwdriver you shouldn't strip the heads. I think using the wrong size screwdriver is the real reason for many of the stripped screw head complaints.The instructions say to put a tiny bit of soap on the screw threads to make it easier to install the screws (an old woodworkers' trick).

17361,17362,"First off i am writing this review as of 3/3/13 and after a few weeks of use and the newest firmware update.As I'm sure you've seen there are many complaints about this headset in regards to the bugs it had at launch. Its very unfortunate that these were present as it irritated a lot of people but as of this writing THIS HEADSET IS AMAZING.I've owned a lot of headphones and headsets in my life, from cheap to mid rage audiophile headsets on multiple gaming and listening machines. I am currently using these on both PS3, Xbox 360 and PC and LOVE them on all 3. Ive gamed online with friends and voice quality is clear and loud using all stock cables. Some complained that the stock usb cable was reason for the bad voice but i seem to have no issue with it.So besides the fact that I've had none of the issues mentioned in older reviews ill hit a few reasons why i love the hell out of these cans.Build quality.Previous to these my Sennheiser HD595's and HD600's were the best built headphones I've experienced and the Astro's are just as good if not maybe a bit sturdier. The metal adjustment posts are a wonderful touch along with the strong composite materials. It truly feels like a premium headset. The cables also seem very well made and are extremely light and flexible. My room mate tested these on Xbox and i had to point out the fact that there was a cable hooked to the controller. He didnt even notice it. The ear cups are also very roomy and though the headset has some heft to it, you find yourself forgetting youre wearing it.Sound.My god these were a surprise in this field. Although the mids lack some of the clarity of the HD595's and 600s the high range is beautiful and the lows very rich and natural. The high range is especially impressive on all EQ settings and i at first thought i had forgot to turn off my surround sound when clicking through the menus on my PS3 because the ""click"" noise was so crisp and felt like it was coming from all around me. Speaking of EQ's I've heard that Astro is soon rolling out an EQ customizer for the Mixamp. The 4 supplied are a great touch but that will really be a huge feature. Footsteps and gun shots are amazingly clear and stand out very well on ""Pro Mode."" Definitely a plus for FPS games.The small touches are also amazing on these. Detachable headset cable, detachable mic, all the extra cable ports on the Mixamp among other things make these extremely versatile. From gaming to listening to music on my computer, to listening to music with my phone minus the Mixamp these cans do it all.So yes they had some problems at first. But If you're reading this now, don't worry about it. Great job to Astro on these they've won a customer.",63.0

17402,17403,"To be clear, The Science of the Quran is not just a book about science as it is found within the Quran but also presents a background on science and on Islam. Because of this, even readers who have no previous familiarity with this religion or with science will have no trouble following this book. One reason for this is the three-part formatting through which information is presented. The author starts by going over the Quran and some of its main themes, the life of the last prophet, and a bit of Islam's history in part one while including some of the prophet's sayings on a variety of topics. Then the author goes on to cover the nature of science and some science history while presenting some principles upon which he believes make up the structure of science.  I found this middle section of the book (part 2) to be somewhat unnecessary considering that part 3 of the book covers the science as it relates to the Quran with the verse translations and interpretations in the same small section. Also, some sections of this part were very general and self-explanatory to the point where leaving them out wouldn't have taken from the book. However, if you do not have a background in science or don't remember much from your science/history classes then you may like this section because it is a nice brief review.The significance of this book is in part 3 where the author goes over different fields of science and how the Quran contains some of the relatively recent discoveries despite being written over 1400 years ago. For me, this section was eye opening and the author's translation of the Quranic verses shed a new light on their meaning. I speak both arabic and english and the author successfully showed how slight nuances in translation can result in a whole new meaning to verses. Whether you are a muslim or not, scientist or not, everyone has something to learn from this book. You may not reach the same conclusions as the author because they are based on his interpretation of ayaat but you will think about Islam from a new perspective.",28.0

17429,17430,"I ordered this teapot to replace another glass teapot that I'd had for almost nine years.  I wanted a nice large pot because i love making big batches of herbal tea and sipping them over the course of several hours while the herbs continue to steep. I wanted to get another glass pot for both the aesthetic and the practical. It looks lovely with the tea and it is completely neutral to the flavor.  One reviewer mentioned that this pot is so large that they couldn't just make tea for two -for me that was a selling point!Cons: the lid, which fits perfectly when the tea is hot, is a bit loose when it's lukewarm or cold.  As with any glass teapot, if you aren't careful it will break, though this one has a nice thickness to the glass,  so it's not eggshell fragile.Pros: It is BIG, 1.8 liters! Almost two quarts!  The fine mesh strainer is stainless steel and is deep enough to hold enough tea/herbs to make a flavorful tea and it won't strand the tea out of the liquid after the first cup.  it's also fine enough for loose leaf peppermint tea, which fell through the previous strainer i had.If you drink a lot of tea,  this is one i would recommend.",29.0

However, if you are willing to put in an hour or two, you should find that the  final product works better than imagined. I purchased along with the Swim Time 16-Feet x 32-Feet Rectangular 12-mil Solar Blanket for In Ground. My biggest fears were (1) that the tubes would collapse under the weight of the cover when it was rolled up and (2) the reel would be unstable and move around while rolling. However, neither problem has occurred (so far after one month). Only problem is that sometimes I need to pull the cover taut if I notice it starts to bunch up in the middle as I crank it up. Otherwise, it makes a world of difference covering/uncovering as compared to dealing with a cover without a reel. It's smooth enough that my wife and children can work on their own.

It recalled to mind [[ASIN:0394742575 Sex and Death to the Age 14]], not for stylistic reasons, but because the focus of these stories is relentlessly those of a teen. Disease, arousal, death, smatterings of religiosity, more arousal, more death, more disease. Then too, there is the clear influence of an MFA program interlaced throughout.

17461,17462,"This canister is perfect for a 12 to 16 ounce bag of ground coffee. I love the tinted color and look of the lid and shape.

I love the push down knob/handle in the middle which makes it airtight. It forms an excellent seal and is super lightweight and compact. This beats leaving my coffee in the bag. I go through coffee very quickly and this keeps it very fresh. It would only be better if it were dishwasher safe and less of a struggle to put the rubber seal back on after handwashing it. (But my 13-year-old took over and it was a cinch for him to put the seal back.)  I definitely recommend the canister, which could be used for all kinds of items like pasta, candy, cereal, sugar, really anything.

So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink.I like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don't squeak.The markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected!The color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don't have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror.

17472,17473,"*** Updated Review:  Be Aware of Roast Date to avoid older roast date Beans.  Coffee Beans are to be enjoyed when they are fresh roasted.  They are a perishable product that can go stale.    I have been subscribing to this product, and have often being sent older stored roasted date beans.  Fresh roasted coffee beans reach their ""peak"" at about 2 weeks after roasting, and diminish from there.  My last shipment was 3 month old beans under my 'Subscribe and Save'.  The original beans are quite good, but no longer being 'fresh roasted' by the time I receive them was disappointing   I had to discontinue the Subscribe and Save as a result of this...    How to read a Coffee Bean Direct Date Code at the bottom of 5lb bag:  First off, the ""Expiration Date"" is exactly 1 year from the Roast/Packing Date.    Second, the date code is written as such: (example) ""26714.02 ""  EQUALS ""267""th day of year (20)""14"" . batch ""02"".  267th day of year is Sept 24th; 14 is year 2014; .02 is 2nd batch of day....    Being sent 3 month old beans is the fault of warehouse inventory control.  I believe the vendor does freshly pack his beans, and sends to Amazon warehouse.  Then Amazon stockpiles it into warehouse storage, and ships out older stockpiles...  I really want freshest roast date product, so I have to again change vendor sources...    **** Original Review***  I have been using Malabar Monsooned beans for about 8 Years, and I am glad to have this new source to choose from.  I feel that monsooned malabar is optimal for Cappuccinos, as its smoothness complements micro-foamed milk quite well.  My first pull from this new order had a very nice crema, dark golden colored as hoped for and expected. Smooth and rich.  City Roasted, roasted till the first crack and allowed to rest before finishing, had the characteristics I wanted, not too darkly roasted...  So for people who want to grind their beans via a burr grinder, and pull a golden shot via their dialed in espresso machine, I can recommend this.  I don't use this for drip coffee, so I can't comment on that, but this makes a pretty good cappuccino via my Gaggia Classic.  4.25 Stars",61.0

17490,17491,"You can see my story below on this unit. At this point I'm changing my review to come from a different perspective.    No product is perfect. That is why customer support is so important. Every product has some percentage of units that have issues. The better designed and made the product, the lower the percentage, but the percentage is never zero. I would have to believe from the reviews on Amazon, that the Trym II has very few units that have issues. I just happened to get one of them.    That's where customer support comes in. In our house, we recently had a flagship smartphone from a well know fruit company have a swollen battery. It wasn't a big deal, because we took it down to the local fruit store and promptly got a replacement. I don't hold the faulty phone against them - because it happens. No matter how great the design or manufacturing process. In fact, I continue to buy from them with confidence, because I know they stand behind their products.    The makers of Trym II have shown that they stand behind their product, too. And I have to say, that is much harder to do at this low price point than it is for the big fruit company. If you're considering this trimmer, I can whole heartedly recommend that you purchase it. The product works great and if by some extremely small chance your unit has issues - the company stands behind it's product.    ** UPDATE 8/22/2014 ** I have received a full replacement trimmer (including all attachments and accessories) by 2 day UPS delivery. Another win for Pure Enlightenment customer support.    ** UPDATE 8/21/2014 ** I have received a tracking number for a replacement unit that is to be delivered tomorrow.    ** UPDATE 8/20/2014 ** I was contacted by A to Zen support shortly after my review went live.

I actually liked this trimmer a lotwhen it was working. But an 8 month life span isn't good enough. The trimmer does look nice, but don't mistake that for a quality build. The pictures make it look much nicer than it actually is. I think what this trimmer had going for it was the simple plastic ""hair guides"". A lot of the other trimmers have a single cage that adjusts and in my experience those just don't work very well.    I'm going back to using my monstrous Wahl hair clippers on my face.

17504,17505,"I just retired my Keurig after two years of use.  I didn't want to buy another one, because the Keurig started malfunctioning just about a year after I bought it, I was tired of buying expensive K-cups, and I missed the treat of french press coffee made with fair trade, organic freshly ground beans.  So, I ordered this french press in green and some beans from my favorite purveyor, DeansBeans.com.  Overall, this is a good french press.  Don't expect your coffee to stay warm with any french press, as a warning.  They are made to brew the coffee, not keep it warm.  After brewing, press the coffee and then transfer to a carafe or thermos to keep warm.  My only gripe with this coffee press is that for me the press doesn't extend down far enough.  The press part stops at about the point where the green lines the bottom of the glass container.  I rarely make a full press worth of coffee, so I know I'm wasting coffee because the press won't go down far enough to separate it from the grounds.  Knowing that I mostly only brew about 8 ounces at a time, I probably should have just got a smaller press, but I wanted one that could handle more for when I have company.  I guess you can't have everything, but I really do wish that they would have made the metal pole on the filter just a bit longer so that you could still feasibly brew less coffee with less grounds and get all the coffee out of it.  (If you try to brew 8 ounces, for instance, you can only get about 2 or 3 ounces out of the press...I've taken to brewing 16 ounces, which gets me about 8 ounces out of the press)",42.0

17513,17514,I use this heater to keep my daughter's bedroom warm at night in the winter. Her bedroom is on the colder side of the house and the thermostat which controls the heat level to the other bedrooms is in a bedroom on the warmer side of the house. So her bedroom is too cold while the rest of the bedrooms are fine. I bought this heater because it has a temperature control that I can set and not worry about leaving the heater on when we go to sleep. The heater will only turn on when it needs to and turn off when the desired temperature has been reached. The reviews I had read about this heater said is very quiet and I have to agree.

I doubt it'll last the year at the rate the bristles are falling out.  I'll probably take action and use a hot epoxy to flow across the head, or perhaps some super glue to set the bristles.

17547,17548,"First off I want to say I love them and am very happy with the purchase. I got the 4mm in stainless set. I can even see buying the gold 4mm set as well in the future. The colors are lovely and the stones are large enough to really show the color. The packaging was small sterile piercing packs so if you are using them to actually pierce your or somebody 's ears then that might matter to you. I didn't get these for piercing, only for my own use as regular earrings.These have large posts and I knew that from other reviews before buying. I have ears that want to close up fairly fast so that didn't bug me. I actually wanted the larger posts to help stretch my tiny holes just a bit. However they are large posts and that might be a problem for some. For those unfamiliar gauge numbers, they get smaller as the size gets bigger. I used a caliper to measure the earrings I was pierced with and those are a 20 gauge. 18 to 20 gauge are typically used for most regular earrings. These measure out very close to a 16 gauge. Perhaps just a bit smaller like a 17 gauge? They are a bit tight for me going in and probably will be for most people who don't have their ear piercings stretched. They will fit but just be aware that it is bigger then most posts. These earring posts are just big enough to cause me a touch of discomfort and a speck of blood from getting them in. I am hoping to get my holes to this size because my ears just want to close.The only other thing I feel I should mention is that the posts seem to be the same actual length as most of my other earrings however...These earrings don't fit like others because of the thicker posts. It feels shorter on the ear. Now I have fairly thin earlobes and these do feel fine but because of the thicker post the post feels shorter as well. Like I said its pretty much the same length post as almost all the others I have. It just feels shorter.Here is my take on these.If you have thick earlobesthese probably won't work for you.If you have tiny holes then these might feel uncomfortable going in. Even cause a touch of bleeding.If you have holes that are a bit stretched already then these might fit better then regular 18 or 20gauge.If you have have tiny holes that want to close up fast then these might give you the right amount of stretch to your holes to open them up a bit but keep in mind you should treat your ears as re-pierced for awhile till they have a chance to get used to being this size.",67.0

17558,17559,"This carrier has been great. There are three main things I love about it.1. It was a waist belt. A lot of carriers that can have the baby front facing only have the shoulder straps. Those kill your back after a while. I can hold my 20 pound baby for quite a while with no back pain.2. It's really easy to adjust. My husband and I both use this product quite often. My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.There's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.It's a great carrier.

Krill oil is one of the most nauseating odors I've ever smelled. But it's no worse than fish oil. It's just the nature of the product. Leaking krill oil capsules have happened twice in the bottle and a couple of times in my pill box, coating the other medications in the pill box. There's no way to clean it up enough to get rid of the odor. I had to throw out everything that was contaminated. I couldn't get past the odor enough to put coated krill oil capsules and coated medications in my mouth. Please keep in mind, though, that this only happened maybe 4 or 5 times. I've consumed maybe 120 capsules so far. That's not too bad I guess, especially since I think I've solved the problem.I store both the bottle of krill oil capsules and my pill box in the fridge to keep the krill oil cool and viscous. So far, they haven't leaked again. If it continues to keep them from leaking, then I'm a happy guy. I don't know how krill can stand themselves.",33.0

17611,17612,"I've played the game for 3 months now, and overall I'm just disappointed. The only reason to play this game; it clearly has a large base of players for online multiplayer - including my family and friends. The negatives far outweigh that, however:1st Player GameplayThe story - as always for COD - is terrible. It's a hodge-podge of random events that happen for a string of characters that I have a hard enough time telling apart, let alone feeling emotion for. No redeeming value here.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is very disorganized; most notably in how it ranks players. Unlike other games, any give player is placed in a game with both beginners, and expert players. The game refuses to rank games by skill, and the disparity of player ability is unbelievably frustrating.VisualTeams, opponents, scenery... it all looks the same. Granted, I am moderately color blind, but you can't tell you teammates from your foes until the ""gamertag"" floats above their body. The problem is, that notification above each player is both very difficult to differentiate, and very inconsistent in appearance (if someone runs around an object it often doesn't appear until they are well into the room).SystemAgain, I've been playing for 3 months, however, each time I try to play with my friends (of which we have a group of about 6) we struggle to even get everyone in the same game. The UX is absolutely terrible. We cannot send game invites, we cannot setup parties, and we cannot communicate even after inviting all to a group.

17632,17633,"When the rumor mill started condensing about Nikon's new offering I was hopeful that they would produce a camera that would finally give me the impetus I needed to make a major system switch. The D3s was just about enough, but it had slightly less resolution than I was hoping for and just didn't quite seem worth the price. When the official specifications were released for the D4 I was thrilled as it was pretty much identical to what I was hoping for. Now that I have it in hand I am thrilled with it in virtually every regard.I went with the D4 for it's high ISO capabilities and it certainly does not disappoint. Every native ISO it offers is good enough that I feel comfortable using it for virtually any purpose. ISO 12,800 is very satisfactory for 8X10 and even larger prints, and anything below that is pretty much perfect for whatever you want to do with it, assuming the original exposure is on point. The other features of the camera stand up to rigorous use as well and I look forward to the process of learning the ins and outs of all of them.The only niggle I have with the camera is the seeming inability to set the front Fn button (right next to the lens mount) to an ISO button. That ability would make the camera a 100/100 instead of a 98/100 for me.Overall I can't recommend this camera highly enough!",23.0

17644,17645,"I highly recommend this item. The price on this may have gone up some, I bought one some time ago. This is a VERY GOOD strap. One of the frequent problems with such items is that the metal is often a very low quality, planned obsolescence type of metal that I believe is called ""pot metal"", almost something like metal manufacturing leftover scrap materials, and the mechanism when a strap is made of that will tend to bend out of shape or break, or bend out of shape and then break when you bend it back.I bought this strap back more than a year and a half ago. I am kind of rough as far as loading a bag up a lot and was using the strap to often walk four miles a day to a bus plus sometimes hanging groceries off the bag on the way back. What I say then is not typical entirely typical use But the strap lasted and lasted and lasted in spite of my putting great strain on it. It lasted a lot longer than any strap I had ever had, perhaps about a year and a half or more, when straps usually gave out on me in, perhaps, two months. One day it broke. I had overpacked my bag and then had additional materials hanging from it.This may sound silly, but I actually felt saddened, because I had been able to depend upon this strap like no other.Then the thought occurred to me to check on whether there was a guarantee. There was, and although I had to mail the strap in to them, they promptly, courteously, without question or grumbling fixed it.If you are an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, you will not need this strap. But if you have to depend on a strap to carry a bit of weight and you need for it to last, I highly recommend this strap.And if you ARE an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, try to get the producer to supply you with this strap with the stipulation that you will be allowed to take it home.",33.0

Tech support was very knowledgeable and helpful.  When I went to buy an internet programmable lock, two of the locksmiths in town said they did not sell the Resort Lock and would not service it if it ever needed servicing.  It turns out that those companies get a kick back from the monthly lifetime fee you have to pay to have the other lock. I would resent paying the obligatory 8 to 16 dollars a month for something that should be part of the cost of buying the lock. The Resort Lock is internet programmable, looks and feels sturdy, and has great tech support. Even if this lock ""fails"" before the other company's; with all the extra money, I'll buy another.*** After having this lock a while- it functions fine during the day, but is impossible to see the keypad at night. If you did not know where the numbers were on the keypad, you would not be able to enter your code without a flashlight.

I received this clock on Friday, and I love it!  It is very well made and solid!  It is just the right size for my apartment and the chimes sound wonderful.  I decided on this particular clock because of the Seiko name and the reviews written about it.  It takes one C battery - not the AA that is noted in the description. The battery is included.  I love that you can adjust the volume.  Living in an apartment building I didn't want to annoy the neighbors.  I have it set about 1/2 way and it is plenty loud for me.  I noticed when I tried putting it below halfway that it didn't chime at all.  It has the option of turning off the chimes at night.  There are also 2 different chime selections.  I have always loved the Westminster chimes so that is what I have mine set at.  I find it quite soothing and my cat isn't annoyed by it either.  I keep the chimes on 24x7 and am a light sleeper - but am not bothered by it at all. It chimes every 15 minutes and chimes out the hours at the top of the hour.  It appears to be keeping great time.  The price is very reasonable too.  I would highly recommend it.  I shot a short video of it and posted it to my FB wall - and have received great comments about it.

I have yet used it from FPS gaming but it does well on Darksiders and League of Legends. It has a very nice build, the only flaw is that the buttons that rest on the thumb isn't as flush as the rest of the mouse, a very small amount of play is there but it isn't the only thing wrong with it. I believe it is made from the USA so thats a plus if you want to ""buy American"" as this is a quality product. One other tick is that the Anchor is the only thing that could change in the light color, not the scroll wheel or those three lights near the index finger.

I did and you will find out that this stuff is not a hazardous substance the other reviewer makes it out to be. Is it used as antifreeze?  Yes, only because it is used to replace Ethylene Glycol in antifreezes which IS toxic.  Ethylene Glycol can lead to kidney malfunction and even death if you ingest enough.  This product does NOT contain Ethylene Glycol.  The FDA includes Propylene Glycol on its Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) list.

17756,17757,"These is a really good head unit.  However, it does have some drawbacks.  First, anytime you hook up your phone (i have an iPhone) and you want to play the iPod, the unit will always start playing the first song in the alphabet.  Even if you turn your car off take the phone and come back to the car to start playing where you left off, it will again start at the first song in the alphabet.  That part annoys me.  Next the microphone for the bluetooth is not that great.  People have a hard time hearing me, and I like to do voice to text when I am driving.  With the bluetooth, it has no idea what I am saying, and therefore, has kinda made that feature useless.  The last issue I have, which may not be a big issue to some, is that when you turn the unit off, the LCD screen stays on.  It will say that it is off, but it is still lit up with the animation still going.  I also think that the apps that are useable by this head unit are too limited.

17787,17788,"This TV was a replacement for a 5-year-old, 26-inch ""flat screen"" LG TV for use in a bedroom.For starters, the TV's bezel is extremely narrow and the TV is MUCH thinner than our old TV.  Additionally, I was surprised how much lighter (at least 15 pounds) this TV is than the older LG.On to the important information... This TV's picture is beautiful!  I cannot over state this.  Samsung LED TV's are simply gorgeous, and this ""lower-end"" model is no different.  It's much better than the older TV and is similar to, or better than, our primary 55"" Samsung LED TV.  Colors are vibrant, whites are bright, and blacks are dark.  Setup out of the box took around 30 minutes--this included screwing the base to the TV and completing the simple, guided on-screen setup.The contested point, and what I was worried about:  the sound.  In my opinion (and more importantly the wife's!), the sound is perfectly fine for a bedroom TV.  And I'm sure it would be OK for a primary TV setup (although a soundbar would be MUCH better).  My only complaint about the sound is that there is little graduation between the low and high volume.  What do I mean?  To me the TV is quiet, and then it is LOUD!  There is little ""in between"" volume.  Other than that complaint, the sound is fine.Overall, this TV is a great buy.  It has an awesome picture, and is a perfect TV.",49.0

17936,17937,"BTW, a little background: In January, I was hit by a car while biking. I had a bicycle headlight; but apparently, the driver didn’t see me.I was pretty banged up—but thankfully, I was able to walk away from the crash. My bike sustained serious damage, I was bleeding, but all x-rays were negative. Whew.Among the “casualties” was my bicycle headlight. The driver agreed to replace it.She meant to give me $20 for a new one. I think she mistakenly gave me $40. I called her to return the money to her. She felt badly about the whole thing, and didn’t really want to come back for the money. She also was pretty sure she gave me the correct amount.I proposed a compromise: I said, “I’ll tell you what; I’ll use the extra $$$ to purchase a better headlight; that way, “next time” we can proactively attempt to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.She loved the idea.So, with $40 to spend, and now looking for a top-quality headlight, I found your product—for $39.97! ( I warned the driver that I may be a little off from my $40 price, LOL)I am so far very happy with both my purchase and your friendly and professional customer service!One last story: The other night, I was biking late at night. A stranger sees me, starts jogging alongside me, and says, “Hey, where did you get that light? I could see you coming a block away!”How’s THAT for a great review?",39.0

I do load it with books and that's a really heavy load, and it performs great.UPDATE 10/10/13  Well, it lasted almost exactly one year.  Everything about the bag is like new, and I use it 5 days a week, so I am impressed with the overall quality of the bag.  BUT the telescoping handle suddenly decided it does not want to work. Without a working telescoping the handle it's not of much value to me (I don't fancy picking it up and carrying it when the handle refuses to extend)  So I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars. It's a pity, it's a great bag, it's that damned handle..........",32.0

It took about a week for my acne to go down and now it helps to control it. I love the pH toner it's much better than the proactiv one. I will definitely purchase again.",19.0

My 4 year old miniature dachshund suffered a disk injury and was beginning to show signs of nerve damage and paralysis in her hind legs even with a course of steroids and strict cage rest. I needed to quickly decide between surgery and conservative, alternative treatment. After research I decided to use a combination of the Ligaplex II, Vetri-Science Vetri-Disc, strict cage rest, and acupuncture. I sprinkled one capsule of each on her food twice daily. I'm happy to say that she has made a full recovery. I continue to add this to her food since dachshunds are known for their disc problems. People who saw her when she was ""down"" are amazed by the results.",22.0

The sound quality is decent if you want a cheap soundbar and you have a well insulated CONCRETE apartment/condo, or you live in a house and don't have anyone to disturb.The base is very loose, loud, and exaggerated, not great, and it cannot be EQ'd down.

It still functioned but I didn't use it very long before it was lost. Got another one so I could take it with me on a medical mission trip to Africa. There are many travel mugs available on the market today, but I bought this kind specifically for the carabiner handle. The handle definitely was convenient while I was in Africa because when I finished drinking my coffee at work, I could simply clip the cup to my bag and not have to carry it or worry about something leaking out into the bag while I was walking home. My frustrations with it are again because of the base. This time it's not wobbly, but there must be small holes or fractures in the frame. When it was delivered I put it in the sink full of water to wash it. I took it out and there was water stuck inside the walls of the cup. I had to let it sit for over a day to slowly drain out. I'm sure there will be rust in there over time so I will probably not use it on my next Africa trip. The cup is a great concept but uses poor design and materials. Wish it was different because I love having the clip but hate the base problems. The lid had a tight seal but the part you slide open to reveal the drinking hole also came undone sometimes.",35.0

18209,18210,"Being a weekend recreational golfer, I'm always on the lookout for training tools to improve my game.  This Sklz Ball-First Trainer/Ball Striking Mat looked promising.Likes:>The purpose of this training mat is to train proper ball striking techniques, specifically a proper lag, a downward strike, and a square clubface at impact.>Made of a high visibility, flexible, and hefty material that's easily rolled up and stored into a golf bag.>This J-shaped mat has holes near the four corners for placing golf tees to stabilize the mat.>Clear visual club path guides which are at a very slight angle to the arrow/intended path of trajectory.>Markers enable analysis of proper downward strike by looking at the divots created past the ball position line or impact point.  However, divots (dirt scooped up by the swing) made would only be visible on grass, not on artificial turf at some driving ranges.Slight Concern:Initially, I was hitting this mat all over the place but the goal here is proper form, control, and swing path.  Gradually, the mat moved less, meaning my swing has improved.  My brother laughed at me for being such a precise, technical geek.How has the training mat worked so far?I have used it during a practice round of golf with more experienced family members.  The mat has helped me line up properly and hit the ball squarely with the clubface with improved consistency and accuracy.  It not going to transform recreational golfers into pros overnight but does provide basic guidance for proper positioning relative to the ball for more consistent strikes and accuracy.  This mat will not replace an experienced golf pro instructor but will provide fundamental ball striking techniques training for most beginners and amateur golfers.",40.0

It is true that both have cameras with greater megapixels - but a million megapixel camera on a 1mm screen is still going to receive insufficient levels of light to make a halfway decent photograph.  I took pictures with all three and realized very quickly that the HTC One, with its 5 megapixel dual camera, produced higher quality photographs than the others.Then I tested their screens.  It wasn't a hard sell.  I popped up several videos from different sources (youtube, vimeo, amazon) and played them on all three.  The LG and Samsung phones had surprisingly grainy screens, while the HTC One screen was quite clear.The HTC One is also good on size.  I do not have to strain to see anything or use the screen.  The speakers were slightly better quality than the LG and Samsung.  The battery also lasts a very long time, especially when I change it to Energy Saver mode, which makes it so it doesn't vibrate every time I type something into it.All in all, I find that the HTC One m8 is a better smartphone.",31.0

18242,18243,"We've been using the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub 1 TB Media Center for 9 months or so and when it works, it provides a very nice entertainment experience.  The image and sound quality are great, the system plays back almost any file format that you feed it, and, when it can find/stay connected, playback of media from other devices on our network works well.  We keep our media on a NAS and so the Hub's NAS support was a major determining factor for us, but the support is not very strong.The Media Library feature would be fantastic, if it worked. This feature grabs and displays metadata for your media, like screencaps, reviews and cast details from videos, in a browseable interface. It also (supposedly) tracks recently added media and recently viewed/listened media, to help you more easily access things that are in your heavy rotation.  The few times that system has been able to scan our media (less than 100 GB of movies, approximately 500 GB of music), we've really liked this feature.  The initial library scan takes hours and even if we set the system to not rescan on reboot, it does anyway. We thought maybe we were asking too much for the Library to work with our NAS (although, were disappointed that that might ebe the case), so we copied our media to the Hub's drive.  But even playback of local media is sketchy -- on start-up, the system can take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes before it can find media on _its own drive_. And anytime you switch sources, say from the Hub's hard drive to a network share, the scanning has to be done again for the Library to function.If you don't care about any of the advanced features, or the number of clicks and pauses it may take to play back a song or video, the Hub _does_ work as a basic media playback device.  But that's not how Western Digital advertises (or charges for) it.We've give the Hub a fair shot -- we're relatively technically adept in my household and we've read manuals and forums and have tried a variety of settings to no avail.  We even tested it beyond the Amazon return window, hoping a charmed combo of settings or a firmware upgrade might fix these issues, but the upgrades seem to center on the addition of new services, like Spotify or MLB.com and we've noticed no improvement in the issues that plague us. That sort of expansion is welcome, but we'd rather the focus was on making the device's basics solid.  We're stuck with the Western Digital WD TV Live Hub, but we don't recommend it.",37.0

18312,18313,"After a 17 day road trip dry run here are my observations:(note: bag purchased primarily for airplane travel as it meets current size requirements)This bag is lightweight, easy to handle and you can stuff a lot of things into it.  It rolls well on hard surfaces and slightly harder to roll on carpet, but still not a problem.  I also bought the  week end bag that you can slide over the handleand it also worked beautifully.  It did not try to tip over even one time  the entire time.  This bag is constructed in such a wayto allow you to really carry a lot of stuff, and even though I downsized two inches from my Patagonia MLC, this bag held much more.Note that due to its soft sides, if you don't place it on a hard surface when opened, it will somewhat collapse.  So I avoided putting iton a luggage rack in the hotel.  A small inconvenience.  But there is always a dresser or desk to set it on.  The only problem I had with thebag was that some of the stitching popped out on the cover flap. This seemed to be a stress point as it was 3/4 down on the flap and by the zipper.I don't think I overstuffed the bag, I think putting the weekender on top places stress on the front of the bag.  Rather than returning it and paying a lot of shipping costs, I took it to my miracle worker shoe repair guy and he handstitched it with strong nylon thread.  $8 later it was good as new. Overall, this bag met all my needs. I look forward to taking it on an airplane.

They are the super soft squishy type, which is good because they don't hurt my ears as much after four or five hours in. I work on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, so it's pretty bloody loud where I work, and these combined with the mickey mouses (well, the new mickey mouses, which I suppose we can't call mickey mouses any more) make the flight deck a very ear-friendly place. They will not stop you from getting blown down the flight deck a few hundred feet by exhaust, however, so there's that.The NRR of 33 is about the highest you can get with non-fitted ear plugs. The squishiness of them means installing them can be a bit tricky, as you have to use a gradual pinch-roll method to squeeze them into shape without creating creases that make an imperfect seal.

18452,18453,"So, we've all heard of Go-Go Squeeze, it's a mass producer of fruit sauce pouches, that were meant to have the convenience of Go-Gurt and be long lasting like canned goods or dried foods. But they can be quite expensive, have additional ingredients, and also are not reusable. It is much cheaper, in the long run to buy apples, pears, other fruits or veggies, and yogurt and make smoothies, fruit sauces, or healthy juices right at home. While I wish these pouches came with an e-book of recipes and ideas and also instructions for beginners, these pouches are super easy to use and also easy to clean.My kids love these pouches. I make home made apple sauce, berry apple sauce, and pear sauces and they love that they are like the Go-Go Squeeze they so love, and I love that I know what goes in them and saved a bunch of money by using them. The see through front is super convenient as my kids and hubby can see what is in them and grab whatever variety of whatever I've made and drink it on the go. I like the convenience of being able to grab a pouch and go do what I need to do but still get either a healthy snack or meal substitute (smoothies etc) that leave me feeling refreshed and re-energized.These pouches are easy for me to open from the bottom and fill, yet stay closed tight even when my kids squeeze them stongly. the easy open pouch and see through feature also make them extremely easy to clean and tell if a spot has been missed or if there is still soap in the pouch after rinsing. I really love the screw tops because then my youngest can not just grab a pouch and open it up without help or make a mess as he's prone to doing and yet I can open it up and he can easily drink whatever is in the pouch, whether it be apple sauce or yogurt. These pouches are thick and durable, easy to use and clean, and a great way to save money and know exactly what my children (and my husband and I) are putting in their bellies. Overall a great product and I plan to buy more so I can stock up on home made snacks and freeze some as well for future use.",38.0

The straps twisted and were difficult to adjust for different sized children, there is nowhere to grab the front of the stroller to lift it over the curb, and the canopy broke. To top it off it is expensive and doesn't come with a drink holder.  The seats are shallow and difficult for children to sit in. But none of this compares to the steering issues.

I didn't feel that knocking a star off the review was needed as this is an excellent keyboard, especially if you spend hours working on it, or if you have carpel tunnel.What I found on the MS site was: MouseKeyboardCenter_64bit_ENG_2.2.173.exe.

I have always found them so hard to apply and find that after the application, I usually have air pockets, or didn't align in correctly.  Tech Armor has put those worries to rest!  I opened the package to find that the directions were clear and very easy to follow.  Still, I decided to go to YouTube to watch a video of how to apply it, which made the process dummy proof!  I went into the bathroom and turned on a hot shower to get steam into the air to prevent dust from floating around.  I cleaned the screen with the alcohol pad provided and wiped it down with the included microfiber cloth which made my screen spotless! Tech Armor was also kind enough to include to strips of dust removal tape to get any little pieces I might have missed.  The suction cup is what made this so easy to apply!  It prevents you from accidentally touching the adhesive side of the protector and the fact that you align it up with the home button makes it nearly impossible to align it up incorrectly.  Once I applied it and did the finger swipes, you can see the protector applying!  THIS IS THE FIRST screen protector I've ever had where I have absolutely no air bubbles at all!  I am beyond thrilled with this product!  The icing on the cake is that when I swipe my finger across the screen, it glides so easily that it doesn't even feel like I have a screen protector on!

18545,18546,"I'll just admit it up front: My eyes aren't what they used to be.  And so, confronted with a do-it-yourself soldering project on an auto circuit board in which the online guru who suggests the repair was careful to mention how difficult it would be to see what you were be doing without magnification, I bought this headset. And was it ever useful.  The guru was right.  I couldn't anything with my natural eyes.Fortunately with this deice you get 3 levels of magnification, and I ended up using the more powerful 2, including the little round magnifying glass that swings down in front of one eye.  It was just what the doctor called for and allowed to ace the repair job with screwing it up.One the note of doctor, no this isn't the quality of device that you'll find your dentist or surgeon wearing, or even the jeweler down the street, but for the occasional do-it-yourself project it's perfect, and at an incredible price.You do have to lean in quite close to your project to get the focus correct, and this is where the little light comes in very handy.  It swivels from side to side so you can focus the beam on your work.  This is especially useful when using the round glass magnifying as you have to close one eye to see through it, thus your head ends up little off center over your project.No batteries came with the product, so you'll dig up a pair of Triples A's, and you'll also want to tighten down the screws on either side of the eyepiece holder, otherwise the glass wants to sit on your nose, and this simply isn't comfortable.

I have now traveled over 900 miles of interstate driving at 70+ mph with a bike on this rack and no issues.  It did seem to reduce gas mileage 1-2mpg. You just have to be sure to tighten the knob on the upright support before locking the key on it. I made a few modifications to improve stability. I added lockwashers to all the thumbwheel adjustment screw knobs, and I tightened the upright support with a 7/16"" wrench once in place.  Before placing the bike in the rack, I made sure the bike's brakes were applied by putting bungee cords around them to hold the bike so it couldn't roll forward/backward.  I used Hose clamps covered with foam pipe insulation to better secure the wheels in addition to the enclosed red nylon straps. After 3 years, the U-channel is bent all to hell but the rack still works. I only put the rack on the car when hauling a bike, because the powder coating is quite thin. I noticed light rust in places where the powder coating scratched off. I suspect if I kept it on the car all the time, it would rust alot more. The initial assembly is a pain.  I stripped a bolt, but extras were provided.  Once it is initially assembled, it is not difficult to install over and over to the factory roof bars of my 2011 Honda Element.  Just don't go through any Drive Thru windows or garages.  Total ground clearance was 9'6"" with a mountain bike atop my Honda Element.  The Aluminum Trek Mountain Bike I put on the rack has a very wide downtube and it was a challenge to open the vertical support wide enough, but I got it to work with some coaxing.  When assembling, make sure to install the vertical support with the lock facing the side of the car you want the rack on.

18578,18579,"Works on Cluster Flies! The first ""Tennis racket of Death"" that was sent to me was defective. It happens. The company then sent a replacement but it was an AA model and not the one I ordered which was the C cell. I bought an older farmhouse and needed this for the bugs that are there. Which at this time of year consist of Cluster Flies and Asian Lady Beetles. The AA model took like 6 hits to kill a cluster fly. Sometimes they would drop on the ground and get up fairly quickly. Asian Lady Beetle which sort of look like a ladybug but aren't, tnded to die after being zapped a couple of times.Once the C cell model arrived Cluster flies would die in 1-2 zaps and ALB's would die with one hit. If you've never dealt with either of these pests they are super annoying and can get into the tiniest of spaces. Cluster flies will ply dead by laying on their backs and hide in cracks so tiny you can't figure out how they fit. Lady beetles are worse. When the light and heat comes on these bugs come out in force and both will bite. I fully expected these bugs to explode like popcorn but they are super tough as well as clever. They will walk rather than fly. No idea how this will work on wasps or hornets but will find out in the spring.If you want something that kills quick you really need the bigger model. For stuff like spiders and mosquitos the AA model should work well. For hardier insects get the C cell model you will need it.also be very careful if you go after web spiders. The webs can make contact with the electrical contacts and it will pop and zap as if it were a bug on it. The product works well and as advertised but some bugs are tougher to kill than others and you really shouldn't kill Asian lady beetles with this because they stink pretty bad when they pop from being zapped. I accidentally killed a stink bug with this and whoo wee! did it ever smell. Lady beetles aren't as bad but they do reek when they die.",59.0

It is just the right size to be comfortable under the neck with no straining.  I will say that it is just a tad narrow. It definitely does not span from shoulder to shoulder.  So to protect your back from a freezing cold tub back, you will need to position it very strategically.  Overall, though,  this was a good purchase.  Update 1+ years later: The pillow has developed a few drawbacks over time.    First, it started leaking, which means it constantly fizzles and sputters air out when you're leaning on it.  This can range from insignificant annoyance to major detractor from how relaxing your bath is.  Second, the pillow's exterior is very susceptible to growing bath mold.  If you let this get bad, you will not want to use it in your bath again.  I literally have had pieces of mold flaking off and floating in the tub with me while using this pillow.

18643,18644,"I bought this drop leg holster because I wanted a versatile platform that would accomodate several pistols with or without lights. I like the fact that it can also be used as a belt holster or attached to a vest.Pro: Versatile, holds pistol without light somewhat securely (read cons), durable materials, very good craftsmanshipCon: You do have to set up the holster to fit your size and weapon. Not really a con but rather a fact. However, the instruction manual to set up the holster is lacking. The technical writer needs to be smacked in the back of the head. Clearer diagrams would have been helpful. Once you figure it out, the set up is not too bad if not a bit finicky. The holster IS bulky. I have a Bladetech Revolution holster attached to a Bladetech drop leg platform and it has a narrower profile. I wanted a drop leg that you could roll around on the ground with. I scratched up the Kydex on the Bladetech doing this. While the material is very durable it's also quite stiff. It'll probably soften up with use. I can't seem to get the bellows that accomodates the light to close down enough to prevent the pistol from rocking a bit fore and aft(the pistol doesn't have a light attached).Addendum: I had to return this holster due to the retension strap snap not being strong enough and the bellows being too loose. The rocking of the pistol fore and aft became a real issue. I could not cinch the bellows down enough to prevent this. I took a Weapons Retension course one night and one of the drills was to have others try and take your pistol (unloaded and safety checked, of course) from your holster. Because the bellows is held down by velcro straps a quick yank rearward would release the straps and loosen the pistol enough that anyone could easily pull out the pistol. Not good in any situation. I think it might have been different if I was running the pistol with a light but I wanted the option to go with or without the light on the pistol. I'm rethinking this strategy and am considering a drop leg dedicated to the make and model of my pistol.",59.0
18644,18645,"This hands-free breastpump bra, is hands down (or up, or really wherever you want them!) the best investment you can make for your pumping efforts -- besides a quality pump, of course. Thus far, I have only been using this bra at home (I go back to work later this week), but I have managed to pump nearly 70 ounces using this bra, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It makes pumping such a breeze, and frees my hands up to do other things (or even just relax). In fact, I'm wearing it and pumping RIGHT NOW, as I type this review at 80 wpm!I use the Ameda Purely Yours, and the flanges fit and hold perfectly. I can't imagine a flange for any pump that wouldn't work. The bra holds the flanges snug and securely against my breast, without being constricting or uncomfortable at all. It feels like I'm just wearing my favorite sports bra. The fabric is very soft and would be comfortable to wear all day, if you wish (and you can add straps to it, to facilitate this). I find it easy enough to throw on over my bra, with the nursing flaps folded down, whenever I'm ready to pump.Sizing the bra was easy. I bought the XS/S/M size. I typically wear size Medium or size 10 tops. My bust is a 36D. There's a Velcro panel on the back that you can adjust as much or as little as you need. I have mine attached about an inch from each edge of the piece. There is also an extender piece that zips on/off in the front, allowing you to make it a little bigger, and also to adjust where the holes are so they line up with where your nipples are. I do not need to use that extender piece. With my sizing, I'd say I'm at the upper end of the size range for the XS/S/M size. Regardless, it fits perfectly and comfortably, and I don't see any reason why I'd need to size up.I've been using it for 2.5 months now, and it still looks brand new. The quality and construction are great, and I see no reason it won't last me a long time.I really can't imagine pumping without it. The only time I've ever not used it was when I've used a manual pump, but it's such a drag having to hold the pump against your breast -- I can't imagine trying to double pump without it (and having to hold the flanges onto your breasts with one or both hands -- certainly not relaxing!). It's nice to have your hands free to read a book, fiddle with the switches on the pump, continue doing your work, or even to do breast compressions if you need a little extra help with pumping. And since being relaxed is key to pumping well, this bra makes that so much easier, making it truly a must have!",71.0

18649,18650,"Too ultra-light action of rod throughout length of this rod.  To fix that, I pulled in the last section of the rod to down into the rod & glued it there, making the rod not as whippy.  Then I noticed the amount of arc/bending of the rod is same all the way down to the handle, which means if you wanted to reel in any small lure you wouldnt feel the lure, meaning you also would have a tough time detecting a nibble if using bait without a bobber.  So you're limited to just bobber fishing with this rod, & even then only if you had shortened the rod like I did so the rod wouldn't bend into a circle if you caught a small fish.  Also btw the eyelets are all-metal instead of any ceramic inside the loops to avoid eventually tearing line, but can live with all-metal guides at this cheap price, it's the arc all the way down to the base that I don't like.On the plus side, the grip on this handle is nice comfortable sponge.

Since I am on niaspan and livalo, my doctor suspected they may have caused the elevated readings.I just randomly happened upon nutritionfacts.org after that office visit, and browsing through articles, noticed[...]  Here's a partial transcript:  The use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial. We know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one's blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming 2 teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test. Basically they make you drink some sugar water and see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control, and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike. A half teaspoon doesn't seem to be enough… but about a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference. A review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly. So what's the controversy? Cassia cinnamon, also known as chinese cinnamon, or probably what you're getting at the store if it just says cinnamon contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver in high enough doses.  For little kids, just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much, and a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone. Nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia. Research shows blunting of blood sugars in response to cassia cinnamon, but in response to Ceylon cinnamon, nothing.Google Korintje liver to see lots of warnings, but you will not see any on the product description here, or on general nutrition advice websites, or from dieticians and (most) doctors., or from dieticians and (most) doctors.",37.0

18764,18765,"I live in a house with 5 other housemates. For over a year I was constantly losing mail because we simply had one tray for everyone's mail. About six months ago I bought this and used a label maker to mark everyone's individual slot. This thing is a lifesaver.PROS:1) The piece itself is very sturdy and well put together. I know this is built to hold paper, so I know I don't have to worry about it falling apart on me.2) There are wooden pockets on both sides that can hold pens, blank envelopes, whatever else you need to put in it.3) There are plenty of hooks to put our keys. We have a mailbox that requires a key to open it and before we got this mailbox we were constantly losing the key for it. Now we are able to keep the mailbox key on a hook and it hasn't gotten lost once since I purchased this mail organizer.4) The very bottom slot is rather large and extends out past the other slots. It is PERFECT for large things that come in the mail (weekly grocery fliers, store magazines, food coupons, etc.).5) The slots can be made larger than what is pictured. The vertical pieces you are seeing that divide the trays into 8 mail slots can be removed. If you do not need all the slots show and desire a larger slot, that can be easily done.CONS1) The slots are a lot smaller than I would have liked. I made the mistake of not checking the dimensions. The slots are not long enough to hold a normal size envelope. The envelope extends about 2 inches out past the end of the shelf. If you decide to label the slots, this makes it very hard to read or even see the labels.2) If a letter comes in the mail that isn't as long as a normal letter, but is taller than a normal letter, then the piece of mail has to be slightly folded in order to get inside the slot. Luckily (for me at least), those pieces of mail are usually junk mail and are not as important.3) The pieces that are used asdividers between slots are very flimsy. The piece as a whole is very well put together and sturdy, but these pieces are not as reliable. However, I have not had issues with any of them as of yet.",46.0

Setting the combo was very easy...just press a small button with a paper clip and choose the combination. The instructions for setting the combo was placed between the cardboard packaging insert, so I can see how it might have been missed by some people.  There is an indicator on the buckle that shows if the TSA opened it with their key, which I thought was a nice feature.  I was able to spot my luggage very quickly on the luggage carousel.

We got the tent quickly, and when it came time to set it up at the campsite, we were able to do it easily. I watched a few of the videos on You Tube so I'd have some idea of how to do it, but the directions were easy to follow on the inside of the tent case.When we got ready to pack up and head out, in a bit of a rush, breaking down the tent and getting it back into the case was super simple - the case itself is a little bit large so that you can get it back in without having to fold it map-like to be exactly the same as it came out. Most of our trouble was trying to get the air out of the tent that had been trapped in it when we took it down.We had a tarp over it through some serious rain and wind, so I can't vouch for leaking issues, but we had a great trip and this tent was a big part of that.I was VERY pleased with this tent.",13.0

When I've set other timers, seeing the fact that there are 10 minutes left makes me rush whatever I'm doing to try to finish before the alarm rings. Not with this one. It's very Zen-like and helps you actually forget time but be mindful when it's time to stop. But yes, if you look closely, near the on/off switch there is a small minute counter.

18811,18812,"I'm a special education teacher, looking for activities that are appropriate for elementary age kids with intellectual disability.  This book sounded good.  In looking at the table of contents here on Amazon, I liked that it seemed to address the standards, etc.But I am disappointed...1 - Over and over, the 'activities' are repetitive games or cutesy activities rather than actual learning activities.  The only things that seem to change are the props - fake spiders., flies, frogs, etc.  The game idea is repetitive ('short path game', 'long path game', etc. Essentially for too many activities, little changes other than the props and what's on the laminated board.,2 - The directions are vague and non-directive.  This is a critical problem since seasoned teachers should be able to quickly skim to find activities to find salient data - 'close reading' only when material deserves it (i.e., is worth the time). ""Descriptions"" meander rather than state the important stuff up front.  ""Materials"" are written as a narrative (vs. concisely)  Critical information (such as failing to include 'go on a field trip' in ""Pumpkin Growing Prediction chart"" (no seeds or seed growing is included ... how can kids predict growth without actually seeing it?)3 - 'Mathematics Content Standards Connection' - fails to list the SPECIFIC standard being addressed- and the ones listed in the beginning are NOT the ones that Kindergartens across the nation use. (""... This activity aligns to the Data Analysis and Probability Standard because children are organizing data..."") (but they're not, since the ""materials"" for activity doesn't include this)4 - While this would be something the well equipped classroom (with all the fake animals, etc., needed for activities) could use, most classroom teachers don't have ready access to fake frogs, flies, spiders, dogs, etc.5 - Over and over the authors write (after 'MODIFICATIONS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS OR SITUATIONS') ""No special modifications are needed... 'No modifications are anticipated ... This activity is accessible to all children... HA! Then WHY ARE THESE KIDS CONSIDERED 'SPECIAL NEEDS'? The authors have not seriously taken into consideration the needs of kids with all manner of disabilities - to repeatedly say no modifications are needed is to ignore the reality that kids like mine won't learn effectively when given instruction like this.  At the very least, these should have been reviewed by special ed teachers re: accuracy.All in all, I am dearly disappointed in the lack of actual teaching instruction other that cutesy activities.A better mathematics choice?

18815,18816,"I grew up in Wisconsin living next to the Mississippi river. The road between my hometown and my college town ran right along the river, winding along, up and down hills with barely a few pieces of wood and metal to keep my speeding car from flying into the water if I happened to hit a nice icy patch of road. Back then, I carried a pair of scissors in my car in case I found myself needing to escape from a sinking car. I would trade in my scissors any day for the security that this knife brings.Not only does it come with an impressive and strong blade, which I will get to talking about in a few, but it also comes with a handy seatbelt cutter. Though I haven't had to use it on an actual seatbelt, I would imagine it would work wonders at freeing me. This blade is always out, but is set back into the knife at an angle, so it is completely safe, even small fingers can't get to it. At the top of the knife is a small piece that juts out and has a bit of a point at the top. This would make breaking a windshield or window as easy as pie if you find yourself stuck in a sinking car. Just the simple piece of metal could save your life by allowing you to swim away.Now, the blade. The blade is a good size. Small enough to carry with you if need be, but big enough to be intimidating. It is smooth at the top and serrated at the bottom. Overall it has a good weight to it and it durable, cutting through tree branches like nothing. I live in Chicago now, and I certainly feel safer with this in my purse at night. And, though it might sound silly from someone who purchased a knife, the best part of this purchase was that the knife came with a detachable flashlight! I didn't realize it came off until the other day when I was using it to look for something in my apartment.Overall, the BlizeTec Survival Knife is a purchase I am glad I made. It will come in handy on my next camping trip, my next trip back to WI, and the next time I need a tiny flashlight.Most importantly, it helps me feel safer knowing I have a bit more protection as well as the ability to survive if an accident occurs.",50.0

I wrote to the seller and printed out the return label and will ship it back Monday morning before I go to work at 10:30am. Since there was no choice for return or exchange, I went ahead and ordered a navy, burgundy, brown, and white, I should get them by the 22nd. The material is a nice quality, soft and comfortable. I took the advice of the other reviewer to size up, which I am glad I did. I wear a size 14 large in tops. XL fits comfortable without hugging. They are a straight cut; I am glad I have found a non-stretch polo. These pique polos skim enough to just above the thigh  (between hip and thigh socket) just covers the abdomen.

I ride my bike to work so I wanted my bike light to be a flashlight as well.My wife and I walked to the corner store to give the light a try. The battery was not fully charged, but I had no issues with brightness.I use the 18650 batteries in my vape  device. I always have two with me. With the battery that was included, I have plenty of light.The tail light was a nice bonus.Overall I love the light. The different modes will be great for camping. I got a great multipurpose light for a bargain price! Batteries alone cost 1/3 the price of the light. The mounts for my bike and the tail light would cost another 20. Wow.... We reached the price of the light before it was added to the equation.Thanks for a great product..",43.0

18845,18846,"My son and I use these while sailing to communicate over wind noises and him being 40-45 feet away from me at times raising sails or dropping anchor.  The full duplex feature is very useful as we can communicate without stepping on each other's transmission.  We were able to carry on a dialogue while anchoring off which would have been impossible with us waving and yelling to each other.  We found we kept them on while we were both in the cockpit simply because we could hear and understand each other better.  We are looking at adding another remote; however, the lack of communication between remotes may present a problem - the ""remotes"" can only talk to the ""master,"" so the master would have to relay communications between the remotes.  Other than that, it's a really nice piece of technology.",21.0

Those wore away very quickly (I drink a lot of canned seltzer water) and soon the bar fell out which makes the two opposing pieces of the handle separate and go all wonky and uncoordinated. The Good News!: I put the bar in it's rightful place and wrapped the handle (leaving enough room for my hand to move around on the grip as the fulcrum force is applied) with packing tape very tightly and it has since been working like a dream.

18962,18963,"I love the Oeuf Sparrow crib yet couldn't bring myself to spend $800+ on a baby bed. I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf.  The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back.  It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so.",69.0

That lamp, because of its design, (and the design of our Yamaha C3 music bench) would not illuminate the entire sheet of music from top to bottom unless the shade was adjusted (rotated) out...and then the LEDs shined directly into our eyes.  Instead of simply returning the lamp, we called Conoco customer service and found out what a great company this is.  After explaining the issue to the tech, he immediately suggested two other solutions for us: a 14"" lamp with a gooseneck arm between the lamp and clamp, and this 22"" lamp, where the radius of the attachment arms is about twice that of the 19"" lamp.  We chose this one and can only say ""wow!""Not only is the lamp more suitable because of the attachment arm radius, it also has a height adjustment which we've set to accommodate some of the larger page-size, antique sheet music pieces we use.  The light quality and quantity is superb and because of the design of this model, it also illuminates the keyboard, without any light overflow into our eyes.  We absolutely, without reservation, recommend this lamp!One final word about Conoco: not only was the customer service tech helpful in understanding and suggesting solutions to our issue with the first lamp, he went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied.  After making the decision to try this lamp, the first question he asked was ""how can WE do this?"" I suggested going back through Amazon.  His comment was that if we needed any additional help, to just call him.  Overall, a very satisfying customer experience.***Update 12/2013***We just bought a second one of these for our son's family.  Each time they visit, they admire this lamp, so we bought one for them as a gift.  We still love it and use it every day.",48.0

Just remember if you're mounting on a pedal board that you will need to purchase or make some sort of aftermarket bottom plate so that you can secure it to your board.

After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's.First of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere.I rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go.

Its soft and keeps him at a perfect incline for his reflux without putting too much pressure on his tummy. The legs seem to be even more sturdier than the last one which had the bar between them. Just to be safe though as not to have the unstable clicking we put down some non slip grips under each leg and double checked to make sure they are even. The lights above him are so cute and he loves them too. Its not as fast as the others had 1st started out to be but still a good enough speed as long as it keeps it up. There's a slightly louder noise to the motor than the last one but hopefully its normal and doesn't mean it'll die soon..

19028,19029,"Our granddaughter is being baptized this weekend and as the local Christian shops have very scant stock for Catholic items, I decided to search Amazon for a nice baptismal cross to hang in her nursery. This particular cross looked perfect - plain but pretty silver, and the shipping weight was 10 pounds (!) so I figured it had to be a bit heavy and at least substantial.I just received it in a bubble envelope - didn't even know what it was at first as the return address listed the name of Larry Sullivan with a residential address (on Amazon it says it's being sold by ""Hail Mary Gifts"", so I thought I was buying from a professional company, not some dude selling cheap trinkets out of his house).I wish I could show a photo of the flimsy, smashed cardboard-with-plastic-cover box the cross came in; even worse, the ""silver"" cross weighs two ounces and is the cheapest little thing you've ever seen! I would return it, but Mr. Sullivan charges a ""20% restocking fee""....so I'm just going to give this to my granddaughter and try to find another gift to add to it - because although it cost $36.00 it looks like something cheesy you'd find at the dollar store.

I have used it all winter in snow from 3-4 inches to 8-11 inches and it is only a matter of taking your time with the deep snow.the negatives, I already lost the bolt that attached to the discharge chute to adjust the height of the spray.  Had to put a bolt i had laying around with some washer in its place to be able to adjust, and this time I put blue loctite on it so it does not go anywhere.  be sure you check the tightness of some of the bolts occasionally or use loctite when putting it together,  Another negative, I assume this is not specific to this make/model, but I used it in 9 inches of snow for 90 minutes, then let my neighbor clear their driveway, and after 90 minutes of them using he returned it saying that the augurs froze.  So I guess I am saying, don't use it in deep snow for an extended period of time because it is possible you will freeze up the fan and augurs, now I need to try to defrost is to be sure that is the real problem and not anything more serious.Overall, it is great, buy it.",19.0

Sounds great, easily pushes the speakers and gets more than loud enough without going above 40% on the volume. The bonus is that it takes up less than 25% of the shelf space of the old receiver.

19093,19094,I bought this machine based on reviews and the fact that it is supposed to be heavy duty.

I finally got it attached but not to I standard I like.  I also broke the jean needle with it in this repair job and it required me to use the hand crank to get the machine started.  Some good notes about this machine are it takes my old singer bobbins as well as universal needles.  I just finished a pair of fleece lounge around pants and it did fine.  I feel this machine is a decent machine and I hope it lives up to heavy duty on my canvas duct fabric tote bags I will be making next.

I bought a ZVOX 450 on the basis of its claims, having never before heard the name, and I had hoped to make dialog more clear -- particularly punch-lines of jokes.  The directions claim it only takes 10 minutes to set up, but I spent 2 frustrating hours before calling ZVOX.  (To their credit, a live United States citizen answered the phone.)  I explained the sound continued to come from the TV speakers as well as the ZVOX causing an echo effect that made most conversation unintelligible.  After half an hour he succeeded in turning off the TV speakers off, but then the ZVOX speakers alone didn't sound any better.  Plus, the mute button no longer worked, so I could no longer avoid those noisy adverts for pills to avoid all sorts of ailments that no one really wants to hear about incessantly.  And certain other functions didn't work either, like the channel-switcher.  After three weeks of only half of what I enjoyed before getting the ZVOX, I called it quits and sent the ZVOX back.  Then I had no sound on my TV, so I had to call Comcast to repair it.  (They gave me a new remote, as the old one had been destroyed in the process of defeating the double speaker problem.  And through all of this the sound quality remained the same, with or without the ZVOX.  So save your money and a huge piece of space (the ZVOX 450 is REALLY big and heavy).

No more battery replacement warnings.  No more homework loss.  No more fear for my very existence.While this was an exciting adventure, (after all, seeing ones true mortally forms a lasting impression), it was a truly worthless battery.Now you may think of this story as somewhat of an exaggeration, but my wife is a native Texan.

I sometimes hook the set downstairs, put on some cd's or vinyl and sit on the porch and they sound fine (about 30 feet distance) When the wife goes to bed, I connect to the T.V upstairs and listen to the game (loud). It comes with 1/4 adaptor and it comes off leaving the 1/8 inch which fits most computers etc. It has an adjustment setting (3 way) on the base for best frequency and a dial on the headset to make it more clear. In some cases it takes a few minutes to get the settings right. Which brings the Con (or one of them) The volume control is directly above where you adjust the frequency settings so if you're not paying attention you can accidently adjust frequency when you want to turn the volume up. The only other con is (and it's only because it isn't in the manual) is this. If you adjust the headset (as in pull one side down to adjust for your head, You have to put both sides all the way back up before putting the headset on the base for charging.

I think these may have actually saved their marriage. He loves them because he can turn them up as loud as he wants and she loves them because NO sound leaks through to the rest of the house. The only thing he said he doesn't like is the length of the cord (like many other reviews) but this is a VERY small price to pay for the quality. He has said that the sound is crisp and clear (mind you this is coming from a partially deaf man) and he couldn't be happier.,20.0
19196,19197,"I bought a lighting deal bungle with this and the Sharp LC-60C7500U for $1,300. Amazing deal! This sounds bar puts out quality sound with a variety of different settings (movie, news, music, etc.) and the subwoofer provides nice bass. So much so that I have to turn it off at times because I'm worried my neighbors below are getting annoyed. I think this is worth the full price but anything under $200 and it is a screaming steal. The one thing I would like to point out is that someone recommended using an optical cable. I bought one, hooked it up correctly and switch the sound bar to optical cable but no sound came out. Not sure if mine is defective but I definitely set everything up right and it didn't work. Instead I used an HDMI cable the sound is thumping.",29.0

19199,19200,"I thought this bag looked kind of ""cute"" and bought it for school. My husband wants it though. It's darker in color than shows here..including the leather. I would say it is more of a masculine than feminine design. Under the clipped front flap there is a pocket that doesn't zip or latch shut. This pocket has a nylon type material sewn to the back of it that has the following organizer pockets sewn into it (think like the inside of diaper bag): one 2 1/2 inches wide by 5 3/4 inches long, two pen sized pockets, 3 1/2 inches wide by 5 3/4 inches long, 4 1/2 inches wide by 5 3/4 long with velcro flap to closure. There is also a small zippered side pocket that is about 2 1/2 inches deep by about 5 inches long on the side of this pocket. I would really like this part of the bag if it had a zippered closure on it. Behind this pocket there is a zippered pocket about 9 1/2 inches deep and 13 inches wide. The main part of the bag is behind this and inside the main bag is a zippered pocket about the size of a pouch pencil case (6 inches deep by 10 1/2 wide). The main compartment is roomy and can hold my laptop, several text books and notebooks wihtout being expanded. There is no padding or separation in the main compartment. The back of the bag has a zipper going across the entire back that opens into a pocket. This pocket also unzips at the bottom so that the bag can be slid over luggage handles. The seams seem well sewn. The shoulder strap is adjustable and has a padded area on it for comfort. The zippers work well. The only downsides for me are the plastic clips on the front pocket...so far they are holding up though and the front pocket under the flap,with the organziers not zipping shut.",60.0

The first time I opened the bottle it smelled bad.I contacted Dr Adorable through email repeatedly, to no satisfaction.  I was told that since it was past the 3 month return limit, there would be no refund or exchange. THEN they told me that it was recommended to keep the oil refridgerated!  I was NEVER TOLD THAT and had never needed to do it before.  I was told in EVERY email what a great quality product they provide. I was also told that it only has a shelf life of 1 year.I went back online to see what product information was provided and found this  statement:“Shelf life- 2 years recommendedJojoba oil may become cloudy and solidify as the temperature drops. This is a normal process that occurs from the hardening of the fats and waxes, and it will become stable at or around room temperature. Because Jojoba is not an oil but rather a wax, its shelf life and stability is considerably higher then most oils and rancidity is very rarely a concern. Deep gold in color and with a mild odor.”The bottle states:  Jojoba OIL!  and here it stated WAX! AND they advertise a 2 year shelf life, but the email stated 1 year.DON'T RISK WASTING YOUR MONEY!

There is extra room inside the compartment (a small padded non-removable insert), where I stowed the data/video cable with ease. (I suppose this section could also be used to hold virtually any smartphone.) The padding in the compartment provides a decent amount of protection, though just like any sensitive equipment case I would still refrain from dropping it on the ground.There is a nice little compartment on the inside lid which uses a loop of elastic to cover the metal zipper (most likely to prevent it from dangling down on the camera while closed), which is a nice place to store extra memory cards and a screen wipe. The two side compartments are complementary, which I will probably use for extra batteries (since the S4200 uses AAs). The detachable shoulder strap is very good quality and will handle a bit of abuse.Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase, considering the prices of other cases out there as well as the reputation Case Logic is known for.

The wood legs are real wood (as far as I can tell) and the trim backboard is strong. The finish on the computer looks like a dark oak or walnut. Make no mistakes this is cherry to black cherry finish. It's much darker than the photo. The plastic (metal-looking) trim pieces look a tad tacky, but this is a really low price point for such a sturdy stand. We had to order the middle shelf bracket again as this plasticy-metal trim was glued on 1/4 inch too far left which made the plastic roll under and jut out at the leg. Whalen said the part was in stock and said we'd have it in 7 to 10 days. That was 6 days ago...we'll see. The metal is strong, but be careful not to over tighten the bolts too much as the metal will give. All the materials were clearly labeled and separated. The best I've seen in any case-goods product.. None of the parts were scratched or dented...one metal bracket was a little bend, but I reshaped it easily. The glass is blackened (painted?) on one side, but it looks just fine from the top.

I have three monitors but only really use two simultaneously at a time, the placing is just one on the left, center, and right, not at all shabby since the focus is usually on one anyway.Cons:Can't say I have any except for the not so Prime delivery, but the wait was totally worth it.",12.0
19295,19296,"This bed looks great.  I haven't had problems with the drawers.  I had mechanically inclined people assemble it for me so I can't speak to the difficulty involved with that.The slab your mattress sits on is not one piece.  It is four pieces of particle board that are held together by metal plates and screws.  These four pieces may not line up well leaving jagged edges on the side of your bed.Within two weeks of use, the support beams (made out of particle board) broke.  Both myself and the other person who sleep on this bed have normal BMI and together weigh less than 300lb.  This is a quality issue.  We went to the hardware store and bought solid wood 2x3inch thick support beams.  We took the bed apart to replace the particle board beams with solid wood ones.  6 weeks into using this product, now the screws for this come loose easily and the bed creaks loudly with little human movement (back to side).I paid about $120 for this.  I think it is worth about $80.  I don't think this bed would move house well.  If you are moving soon, or move often buy something different.  At the rate this product is presenting problems, I don't expect it to function with acceptable levels of trouble past 18 months of use.To stop your mattress from sliding around, place a rubber mat under it.",44.0

Machining was a little crude but this is expected from Chinese made products. A hole in the threaded nut for the bipod adapter was drilled a bit off center though. This was a quick fix on the drill press. The adapter fit the Ruger well and looks good. It has a black painted finish. The friction leg nuts and release buttons are nicely finished. Good enough for a .22 or a bolt action .223. The bipod is bulky when folded up and is a bit obtrusive. I would not put it on an assault rifle as it would snag on things when on the move.

19314,19315,"Houses need to be maintained and one area that is often neglected is outside cleaning. Most of us keep our grass cut and the shrubs trimmed, but we often overlook the outside of the house itself. This is where a power washer can help and a good tool for the task is the AR Blue Clean AR390SS Cold Water Electric Pressure Washer.I have used power washers in the past but I never had one to call my own until now. This one is better than the power washers I have experienced previously and probably the main difference is the power. This power washer delivers a whopping 2000 psi of dirt- busting power, easily enough to eliminate the grime and other buildup on the sides of your house or your driveway. I was actually a little worried about the level of power and wondered if it would be too much. This made me hesitate a little at first, but once I started to clean, my worries vanished, my confidence increased, and I continued to wash my siding at a fast pace. You can, of course, dial down the pressure a little, but the 2000 psi is fine for most uses and makes the task of cleaning the siding or driveway that much easier and faster.This power washer comes with several attachments like a turbo nozzle, pencil nozzle, fan spray nozzle, and detergent nozzle. These different tips are an improvement compared to the power washers I have used in the past. They allow you to select the right tool for the task, for the best overall cleaning. I haven’t used any detergent or cleaner yet and have used primarily the turbo nozzle since it delivers the strongest stream of water. But it’s nice to know that the other options are available when I need them.I like the reel on this power washer and I like the ease of storage. The power cord is fine for my house because I have outside electrical outlets on each side of my house. If your home has fewer, you may need an extension cord. Other than that, I can’t find many bad things at all to say about this powerwasher. It gets the job done and exceeds expectations on most all levels, making it an excellent choice for outdoor cleaning needs.",51.0

Fortunately my neighbor was home & able to sign for it. The driver was nice enough to place the pallet on my concrete patio, so that was helpful.

Nineteen forty-five marked the nadir of human civilization, to quote Gunter Grass who served in a branch of the SS during the dark world war. I suggest that one read Samuel's work after having digested Solzhenitsyn's "" Prussian Nights: A Poem (1977)"" and M. Hillers's ""A Woman in Berlin: Eight Weeks in the Conquered City (2000),"" possibly in the reverse order. Samuel says (p. 346) ""... the dirt of our lives was not only under our fingernails and our unwashed bodies but had penetrated our souls."" Solzhenitsyn and Hillers in their respective books or rather in their litanies describe in detail when and how human beings turn into inhuman beasts in the midst of the bloody calvary. The only hitch in Samuel's book is that Wolfgang appears to too ably digest the many incomprehensible and complex war situations that even the grown-ups wouldn't be able to comprehend.

I've now been using the bag everyday for the past 13 months and am not as in love with it. The many pockets are great for storing items, but everything falls to the bottom making the bag sag quite a bit. Also, when you put items in the outer pockets, the inside pockets get more difficult to use. If you put anything in the inside pockets, the space inside the diaper bag disappears. The changing mat included has not held up well. It's now taller am the diaper bag and very puffy so it's somehow earned more space despite my best efforts to avoid that.I use cloth diapers and find there just isn't a good spot for my wet bag in here. As much as there are plenty of pockets, items are so hard to find inside the bag. The bottle holders on the side are nice. I've finally stretched them out by forcing water bottles in them so now any cups will fit. Some sippy cups are still too wide for them though.I do appreciate that this bag will let you fill it full. I bring everything with me and I can fit it every time. I find I'm never able to zip the bag though because the shape has changed so much with items in it. It does get heavy quick.I agree with other reviewers that the straps don't hold up. Mine are cracking and fraying quite a bit but are still working.

19349,19350,"They taste good. But I'm not so sure about their quality control.In the photo I've uploaded, you can see the size variation between some of the gummies. The larger one is the standard size, but there were quite a few like the stumpy one. I didn't count them, but the product is sold by units rather than weight, so presumably I got less. Not such a big deal I guess, but when you consider that we're only really going by their word as to what's inside the gummies, the lack of quality control on the size doesn't exactly fill me with confidence that the right amount of vitamins and minerals is going into the product.I've noticed issues with their other products too, where this is quite a variation between packages of the same product - some where the gummy is softer, others where it is harder. Some where there is a lot of sugar dusted on them, some where there is very little and they all stick together in a big glob.That said, I continue to buy them because they taste good, they're easy to take, and it's better than nothing.

19354,19355,"Having only used smaller shoulder bags before and with the quantity of my gear increasing I decided I needed something different and this was a backpack or maybe a sling.  After hours of research I decided on this one... and I was a little skeptical at first... trying to imagine before I bought it exactly how well I'd like this style of backpack.  The verdict is in - I am more than satisfied with this purchase.What does it hold??? In my configuration it holds two bodies (one with a lens attached), three other lenses (one is a Sigma 170-500), filters and the hood for that bigger lens.  The padding inside is more than adequate and everything fits in snugly so nothing moves around. The zippered pockets hold a bunch of stuff too though nothing large.  If there were two complaints it'd be that I wish the front pocket was ~15 cubic inches bigger though it still hold two chargers, cables, lens pen, blower, etc.  Second one is below.How does it fit???  Now on to function.  I am 5'9"" and this pack fits me very well.  There are many adjustments to fine-tune the fit and, after wearing for hours at a time during a trip out west, it never hurt.  In fact, I swear I forgot it was there sometimes.How do I get the camera out???  It really is as easy as Lowepro's description says... just take on arm out (I use my left), swing it around to your front (I use my left though to give it a little support) and unzip the two zippers to pull the camera out from the top.  My second complaint, and this one, like the other, is minor - the zippers could be heavier gauge here.  I feel like if I rip them open fast I might break one.  As long as I am mindful of this I don't think there'll ever be a problem.How do I change lenses???  One observation, not a complaint, is that it is difficult and awkward to change lenses while the bag is open in front of me.  I take the bag off to do this.  For landscape photography, which I primarily do, this can bea pain.  But I look at it like this - with any style of bag I am pretty sure the same action has to be taken.  I just put on the lens I think I'll primarily need and deal with changing later.Water??? There are two mesh pockets that easily hold a 20oz bottle... the thinner kind though.  I don't think it'll handle bottles the width of a 32oz. Gatorade for example.In summary, this really is an ingenious design that works for me.  It is comfortable to wear and holds all my gear (and snugly at that).  With the main pocket at my back I know nothing can be stolen while I am wearing it.  In my opinion this pack offers solid value and function for the money.",82.0

19387,19388,"Do Not Resuscitate ventures into the life and mind of an elderly man, Jim Frost, at the beginning of the end of his life. It explores the transition from a past lifestyle that we live today into a future of questionable technology that would make skeptics of religious zealots and atheists alike.  Mixed with humor and irony in a very Vonnegut-like fashion, the author writes his main character, Jim Frost, writing his own biography. Meanwhile his daughter Eliza has signed him up to have his brain downloaded onto a microchip to be saved for some future purpose. Ideally, to be downloaded into a new body.  Toying with the idea of living forever due to such technology, Jim frost remembers his own past for the reader and explores what it means to live in die with stories of family issues, friendly encounters, global evolution, mysterious jobs, and present day elderly life. Bouts of light and dark humor jump out from the text in unexpected moments leaving the reader with wry smiles during a variety of emotional moments.  Personally, I found myself brushing through the pages of an easy read that kept the story new and fresh the whole way through. This isn’t to be mistaken for a sci-fi thriller or expansive adventure. It is a book about life and what humans can very well face in the near future. I am a science fiction fan and I love the idea of both near-future and far future stories(Vonnegut, Asimov). I generally like to read science fiction that provides thought-provoking concepts within a variety of time periods; this is one of those stories.  It is an in-depth expedition into life’s big questions. If you enjoy Kurt Vonnegut, you will enjoy this. I recommend.",53.0

19394,19395,"I probably can't add much more to what's already been written here, but from the first twang of the theme music to the last word spokenin each episode, this left me wanting more.Often gruesome, always realistic, this series not only delves into the psychology of the killer in the case (and also whether the detectives got the wrong man) but it slowly peels away the layers of the two investigators personalities, revealing that neither is as their exteriors show them.  Both McConaughey and Harrelson are perfect as the loner-atheist iconoclast thrust into a partnership with the seemingly happily married man who believes in everything he should. After ten years, the discovery of another body killed in a style exactly like that of the murderer they apprehended brings them back together to be interrogated about the particulars of the original case. Contrasting their present positions in life and beliefs with their former ones, it's a chronicle of flawed characters searching for an even more broken one. (I really felt McConaughey's character, being the man full of esoteric knowledge,  should've reconized the symbolism of the antlers, however, but that might've ruins it as far as the length of the series.)This review is for Disc One but I have no doubts it will stand for the other discs also, and if my hunch is correct about the story's outcome...WOW!",16.0

There are some things you have to understand when using this: Don't use too many codes all once, your game will freeze, believe me on this. Don't use codes from unauthorized sources, this may cause undesired effects like erasing your save files. Keep it clean and don't drop it, whatever you do.

19426,19427,"There are some things I like about this clock: the sound quality is good and the display is very readable even if you're near-blind without glasses or contacts. It keeps going through frequent power outages during the windy season. It's become a valuable part of my morning routine even though I had to move it out of the bedroom.But that brings us to the cons: 1) The display is bright and can't be dimmed, which my husband loathed when he was trying to sleep. 2) The buttons make a very loud and jarring beep when you push them to set the alarm or change audio functions, and the beep can't be turned off. 3) I had hoped to use the clock as an MP3 player, but you can't shuffle the order of songs or use playlists; if you want to switch to more relaxing or upbeat music, your best bet is to have multiple thumb drives. 4) You'd think you could use the USB port to charge devices, but you can't. 5) The FM radio function is good, but when the radio is turned on, the display doesn't show the time.That said, I don't regret the purchase. I ended up putting this clock in the bathroom, where it functions very well as a night light; it also gets me going with news/music and keeps me on track in the mornings without the distraction of using a smart phone for those purposes. (You know: you go to turn on music and end up reading e-mail, checking apps, and so forth...) The no-frills, non-customizable nature of the interface keeps things simple.

19438,19439,"I purchased the str-dn1030 Sony A/V receiver to replace an old school Panasonic Receiver I've owned for over a decade. I have a TiVo HD and PS3 Slim input into the str-dn1030 via HDMI. The str-dn1030 outputs to a wall hung 42"" Panasonic Plasma via HDMI. I have internet connected to it via Ethernet. I operate my A/V system with a Harmony 900 (fully RF).The str-dn1030 connected to a 5.1 system and the automatic speaker calibration feature (via the included mic) was very smooth and easy. I really enjoy the sound quality of this unit. The music and sound effects from the opening bank robbery sequence in The Dark Knight (on Bluray) were simply lovely.Video is beautiful.The GUI on the str-dn1030 is almost laughably bad looking and unintuitive, but is perfectly functional with the assistance of the user manual. I am truly perplexed at how bad the GUI is given how Sony can clearly deliver a better product. Perhaps this will be improved in a future firmware update. All this being said, I find the str-dn1030's bad GUI is better than the no GUI on my old Panasonic Receiver.The delay in getting an image from the PS3 or TiVo to my Panny 42"" display upon initially powering on the unit, or when switching inputs, was initially jarring for me. It isn't ridiculously long, but definitely noticeable compared to the near instantaneous sound and signal transmission I had enjoyed with my video outputs going directly to the display (via HDMI) and my audio outputs going directly to my old receiver (via Optical).FYI, an inactivity power off feature appeared to have been enabled by default at the factory with my unit. I thought I was initially going crazy when watching Netflix Instant streaming when the str-dn1030 ""spontaneously"" powered off on my several times in a row. Sure enough the unit was set to power off automatically after a period of inactivity (10 minutes if I recall correctly).I love the str-dn1030's bluetoothaudio streaming function. Especially where the str-dn1030 fires up instantly from standby as soon as you ""connect"" a paired device via bluetooth. I discovered another tricky spot with the user manual. The glossary refers you to page 101 for Bluetooth Pairing...don't fall for it! Go to page 82 instead.I think the build quality of the unit is very good and overall I'm very pleased with the daily functioning of this device.",61.0

She also includes (fairly) recent neurological theory without reducing everything to simplistic, evolutionary psychological cliche.If you're an incurable romantic, you will get much out of this well-written book.

19489,19490,"This is not actually the story of Romeo and Juliet, but is rather the story of a group of boys in a military academy and a romance between two of them, told using (mostly, but not entirely) the text of Shakespeare's play. The two lovers are NOT Romeo and Juliet; they are Sam and Glenn, who use the lines of R & J as a way of expressing their thoughts and emotions. The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera, in which the story is expressed through songs which aren't meant to be taken literally (that is, the characters themselves aren't really singing--the actors are singing to express the characters). Here, the actors are using the text of a Shakespeare play to tell a different story. (The ending makes it clear that it is a different story.)The actors here are superb, and make the text come alive in a way that I've never experienced before. (And it certainly doesn't hurt that they are SO easy on the eyes!)  Rather than stuffy and/or wooden delivery in affected British accents, we get line readings that sound like actual live humans speaking to each other.  All of the actors had experience performing Shakespeare, although for some this was their first time doing so professionally.

In the meantime I bought a more appropriate camera to reproduce my paintings, so I really didn't need the manual settings in the Kodak anymore.  Anyway, I never did return this Kodak and I use it constantly now because of the powerful zoom and wide lens.  It's so convenient and I'm not worried about abusing it at this price.

However, as matters progress to standard tuning, the recording provides notes that are 1/2 flat of concert pitch (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb instead of E, A, D, G, B, E)!

She mostly rambles about in this video on how she got started with dancing, the MMC, her hometown, and working on her first album and music videos. I do admit that hearing songs like Sometimes and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart does take me back to middle school and how nice and innocent those days were. I actually like those songs better than Baby One More Time. As mushy and corny those songs can be, I did enjoyed the sweet sentiment of those songs.

19582,19583,"This dresser is really easy to assemble. It comes with an alen wrench and you also need a Philips screw driver (the one that looks like an X). Personally, I would suggest a cordless drill just to save your hands and it will also decrease the time needed to assemble this dresser. The pieces all came clearly labeled and any holes properly drilled in the correct location. The drawers took the most amount of time to assemble as there were six of them. The main pieces slide together really easily. After you put the first side up the next step was to place the center piece in place. Prior to doing this don't forget to put in the front dresser trim pieces in place. Overall with two people you should be able to assemble this in about an hour. The total steps to assemble are 8 (including all drawers as two steps.Overall the quality seems to be really good. It is made of real wood and is sturdy.",34.0

Unlike others, there were no reviews of strange odors upon unpacking, and it was packaged quite well so there was no shipping damage as I had seen mentioned in the reviews of other ottomans.  Craftsmanship appears to be top notch even though it is one of, if not the least inexpensive ottoman of this size.  I've looked it over quite thoroughly and I can't see a flaw.  As others have mentioned it is dark, almost black in some lighting situations but I feel it is on par with other ""espresso"" colored furniture in my house so I was not surprised with this.  I use daylight balanced incandescent lighting in my house and when all of the lights in my living room are turned on it is rather bright which allows the true espresso color to show.I also like that it has two, large rectangular interior storage compartments rather than 4 square ones, and that the sides are solid rather than an upholstered over wooden frame like I had seen mentioned in other similar ottoman reviews.All in all I'm really satisfied with my purchase.

I ordered it with Prime and patiently waited two days for it to arrive, the day it arrived I could hardly wait - a moon lit paddle with my expensive lighting on the bottom of the SUP was just what I needed to relax.  When opening the box I was greeted with a nicely made holster for the device that housed the lighting system.  The led lights are nicely made and the adapters all have water proof connections.  When I connected the light up to the battery Viola! NOTHING!  After checking the instructions and verifying the connections, I figured maybe the battery was dead or had low power/voltage, I plugged the battery pack into the charger and waited for about four hours (the led light on the charger went from red to green).  I plugged everything back together and pressed the button hoping for fluorescence - nope.  I called the manufacturer (Nocqua), and was given no reassurance of ever fixing my light, the answer was, ""oh, just ship it back to Amazon and order another,"" I decided to spend $400 bucks elsewhere, perhaps this was a fluke, or maybe I should have just re-ordered another, but I would think something this expensive would work the first time.

This is one of my favorite things I have ever ordered off of amazon.I ordered this to be a piece of my LARPing wardrobe, and was not sure how it would turn out, since it wasn't sold as a ""costume"" per se.  The fact that it doesn't feel like a costume is what sets it apart from pretty much everything else I have ever bought.  It feels like real clothes probably would have felt back in medieval times, sturdy, solid.  More so than even the real clothes I buy at kohls now!  I love the material, it is not hot or scratchy, it is smooth and cool, but still heavy.  I love the way it fits and the way it hangs and the way it moves with me. The only complaint I have is that i wish the tie was positioned a little higher to hang and tighten right under the breasts.  It is about an inch lower than it feels like it should be, and I have DD's! But I can tie the string really tight while it is pulled up where I want it and I can get it to stay there for a good long while.  I could be a touch smaller, yes, and if there was an option to buy a Small, instead of a S/M/L, I would go with that, but on the other hand it is nice that if I wanted to let someone borrow it as a costume, it could fit a variety of sizes, and would be perfect for that.Personally I am about 5'2"", 120 lbs, 26"" waist, and it is loose on me, but the drawstring really makes all of the difference.  Also, as I am short, I have to hold up the skirts when I walk, but I don't mind because it kind of fits the style of the time period I am going for.Also, if you are considering purchasing this for COSplay, like me, this works great as an under-dress for corsets or bodices!I hope that helps!  Seriously, this is one of the best COSplay pieces I have ever come across!  It is an excellent buy!

19667,19668,"Seriously. This has made me so angry to own this piece of crap mouse.I got it because I have smaller hands right?Cool a gaming mouse for smaller hands!  PERFECT.Until I used it. The Mouse JIGGLES AND JITTERS. It's like it's having an outright seizure on my screen! I tried installing drivers, getting the OFFICIAL RAZER MOUSE PAD and NOPE. My mouse cursor likes to dance and flail itself upwards along my screen. Now it'd be fine I -guess- if it was just while it was idling.Sure.But it did it while I was WORKING. I use this mouse not just for gaming and precision, but for Graphic Design, which is like Gaming in that I need precision, so when I'm healing, or when I'm adjusting the size of something in Photoshop the last thing I want is a wonky sudden twitch.I swear to god it's like this Mouse has Tourette's Syndrome. Because EVERY so often it feels the need to jolt and jitter and simultaneously make me groan in agony.Well whatever. Not the worst 30$ I ever spent my money on. I'll just use it, it's decent after any other issues.Except this thing has a huge issue.Sometimes it doesn't feel like being a mouse!Sometimes it feels like being a paperweightBut it's schizophrenic tourette's mouse so it can't decide from one moment to the next! So as it's making up it's mind I hear the constant BABMP. BABMP BABMP. Sound from my computer saying YOU HAVE A DEVICE NO YOU DONT YOU HAVE A NO YOU DONT.And so I tried to get support from Razer. The company that MAKES the bloody thing, their response.""Seems like it's broken""Okay. It's broken now what.""Well you can ship it to us with all the product info and we will send you a replacement.""Okay cool. So who do you guys use to ship?""Anyone you want.""Oh okay so I just give you a receipt and you credit me back?""No you pay for shipping""... Okay but you guys get shipping on the way back right?""No you pay shipping both ways.""So on TOP of buying a JUNK Mouse. I have to pay for the shipping THERE. And the shipping BACK?!Yeah.

19669,19670,"January 29, 2015: I'm amazed at the extremely hostile responses to my prior negative review. Isn't the point of a review to let other buyers know what I think? In deference to those folks, and in view of the fact that I am still using the printer, I changed the headline and added a second star. I'm not sure why my honest opinion bothers people so much. Someone suggested I could have bought a printer with a larger paper tray. Well, first, my choices are limited because I need old-fashioned fax capability. Second, it's the small size of the OUTPUT tray which is most problematic. And I'm still having trouble with the printer over-heating envelopes so that it almost seals them. My prior Brother laser printer didn't do that.    Original review: Would NEVER buy this printer again! It holds very little paper, either in the paper tray, or especially in the output tray. You constantly have to empty the output tray. And emptying the output tray is very difficult, because you can barely get your fingers into the tiny space. And it's far beyond noisy. Each page being printed produces a very loud start-up noise. I actually may have to limit large print jobs to after-hours.    Update after a week: I needed to print an envelope today. Twice the printer was convinced it had a jam, requiring me to open the drum drawer and close it. When I was finally able to print the envelope, it wrinkled it and almost sealed it shut.    I LOVED my previous Brother printer, so I'm especially disappointed in this one.",46.0

19698,19699,"Well-made, smart-looking bag. However, there's only about a 75% chance it will fit under any given seat in economy. After traveling extensively for a full year, I have yet to find a seat that it fits under easily, without having to be squished and shoved mightily (an entertaining spectacle for one's seatmates). Unfortunately this rough handling this leads to undue wear and tear on the bag, making it look beat-up well before a bag of its quality should with normal use. Additionally, when full the bag is a bit unwieldy and heavy for lifting into the overhead bin on the occasions where it doesn't fit under the seat. The back-up bag is smart-looking as well and has proven very useful; in fact I use it more often than the wheelie bag.I wouldn't recommend this bag unless you are a strapping gentleman (or lady) who doesn't mind hoisting this into the overhead bins on the not-infrequent occasion that it doesn't fit under the seat, and is willing to deal with the inconvenience of shoving it under your seat on all other occasions.Here's a chart of some common ""under-seat"" carry ons. Only the first three are true ""under seat"" bags for the purposes of the economy class traveler.

I read through all the reviews on this, and never doubted once that I would have issues with this product. So I went ahead and purchased the White S View case from amazon, with amazon prime shipping. Received it today and I IMMEDIATLY fell in love with how durable the case looks, and feels on my phone. I was really impressed with how firmly it snapped onto the back of my phone. I was slightly skeptical about that, since the back that comes on the phone seems to be flimsy once removed. The  case stays firmly shut after being flipped open for certain periods of time with ease.  Like the phone, the features it presents when the case is closed on the S View screen are fluid and distinct. It has everything I would need when not looking at the phone with the case open. I would DEF recommend this to anyone with a new note III, or who are considering getting this. I work for a bank and constantly have tons of keys floating around in my purse, I no longer have to worry about any surface of my new Galaxy Note 3 getting scratched just by simply tossing my phone into my purse.

19753,19754,"This toy gun is fun.  Good sounds, and neat features like removable clip and stock.  the scope is nothing to write home about, but ok, and it's removable too.Only issue so far is in regards to the stock.  As mentioned, it is removable, by pressing in button on bottom surface. that allows stock to slide off.  However, one of two sides of stock that form this sliding part have broken, which means the stock will not stay attached. The other side shows signs of plastic fatigue (where the plastic starts to turn white due to deformation).  It looks like a design issue and the plastic is just not thick enough.Some may question whether the gun was abused.  The answer is no; not thrown around, not stepped on etc.  Had this for less than a week before this happened.This gun may be able to be fixed  - but it's not really something a busy father wants to spend time on.",25.0
19754,19755,"I read an article once about using toothpaste to clear the fog on headlights. A mechanic friend of mine recommended it too. But after two applications and much scrubbing, it didn't improve one bit. My first thought was that the fog was on the inside and thus impossible to remove, but when I came across the 3M 39098 kit, I figured I'd give it a try.And I'm glad I did. My headlights are now spotless.The process is a bit lengthy; took me over an hour and a half, but my lenses were really bad, so I spent extra time sanding. Each step smoothed out the lenses a little bit more, but the first step was the most important; getting all the staining off so that the lense looked cloudy rather than murky. The instructions are really easy to follow, and provide visual examples so you know what to look for. The only thing I recommend is adding extra tape around tight edges because I ended up scratching my paint by mistake (got a bit wild with the sandpaper).Overall, a very good experience.Note: The kit has enough in it for two headlights -- one car. There were a few things left over, but if you want to do a second car, I recommend a second kit.Note 2: This only works on plastic headlights, not glass.",31.0

19762,19763,"There are small things that I both like and dislike about this product. I am using one for myself and purchased 4 for family Christmas presents. We are using the tall water bottles and I expected the same results with the ""coffee"" bottle.I purchased several of the wide mouth bottles with hydro flip cap specifically for hot drinks. I am disappointed that my coffee does not stay hot as long as I had hoped. I love the flip lid and the concept that it is ""designed in Oregon"" too bad it is still another ""made in China"" item. Even pre-heating the flask I think my coffee is lukewarm within the hour when I have finished about half. On the other hand, we keep ice water in our other Hydro flasks for days... or at least through little league games and swim meets.Note that overall we are fans of this product, we have about 15 of the water bottles in varying styles. Plus the 64-ounce bottle and now 5 of the coffee bottle. The small mouth, regular mouth, and wide mouth bottles have worked best for ice water - while the small mouth bottle lid keeps breaking and does not allow regular ice cubes.

A couple times my coworker used one at my desk and left it with the point out. It was dry for a bit, but I just retracted it and let is sit for a few hours - work fine now!I originally bought a 3-pack at Staples to see if I liked them, but they were pretty expensive, about $8 or $9 for 3 pens.

It's been 10 days and not only do I not have them, Amazon sent me email stating they can't get any shipment info from the seller.  I haven't been charged yet, but I'd really rather have the pens!UPDATE: I did receive the pens, at about the 12-day mark.  A few of them seemed dry right out of the box.  I revived one or two of them by dampening the tip slightly and using it until the ink started working again, but one had to be thrown away.

19770,19771,"My husband has two suits that he travels with, and we wanted a sturdy garment back to pack and store. I really wanted this to solve that problem but alas.First, the good: The size is just right for a suit and a dress shirt or two, at about 42"" long. The exterior pockets can hold a pair of shoes, ties, socks and a belt. It's a bit bulky to put in an overnight suitcase, so he just carried it in that case; when he used his larger suitcase, he was able to fit it. The fabric was substantial, the zippers pretty good.Now, the bad: When I opened the package, I was hit by this godawful chemical smell. There was even a little placard with the Delsey tags that said it had been treated with chemicals that the European governing bodies has identified as a potentially cancer causing agent. Uh, ooooooooookay.... Still, my husband really liked them so we agreed to air them out for a week, which dissipated the smell some; also we'd hang it in our storage closet with our winter coats rather than our regular clothes. However, the time when he traveled with the bag packed in the larger suitcase, it smelled up all his clothes and he reeked of chemical BO on that trip. And when we got back from that trip, we realized that the winter coats in the closet had absorbed the smell so now we've got to air out all those from whatever is on this thing.So, in sum, out they go.

The ""support"" between the two sides of the table is a plastic pipe about an inch in diameter, and the weight made it crack.  Now my left (laptop) side of the table lists down about four inches.  If they could replace the support bar with something made of a strong metal (I'm surprised this wasn't the case originally, since otherwise it seems to be pretty well built), I'd be happy.  Otherwise, it's now useless to me.  I've tried several different things to prop it up, but without the pipe being replaced with something sturdier, it just won't work.  ********* I assembled it in about 30 minutes, and it's just what I needed.  I have another similar one I bought several years ago which is heavier-duty, but it also cost about three times as much.  For the price and utility this was a great choice.  I love having the multi-position slant for my laptop while also having the smaller stationary shelf, not only for my wireless mouse but for other small items I may want to keep nearby.

It was the same piano, very durable, very cute, and very fancy looking.  However, the keys sound a little off on my daughter's piano.  It was not as on key as my nephew's.  I guess every piano was made just a little differently.  I'm still pleased with the purchase and it's still super cute to see my daughter sitting down and playing with the piano.",17.0

19814,19815,"MINWAX Wood Cleaner is the ONLY wood cleaning product that I will use on our wooden furniture, including our wood cabinets in our kitchen and in our bathroom. This AMAZING product is gentle on wood, while cleaning it to perfection. My husband and I, love this product because it does not leave a waxy build up.  It is the BEST wood cleaner around. I have tried other products before discovering MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and there is no turning back. This 'magical' cleaner should not be a secret! I could not find MINWAX WOOD CLEANER in Canada, so I ordered two (2) cases of it online, from the United States. When it arrived to our home, I was happier than a child who had just recieved a present in the mail, of toys and penny candy.  I have squirreled away bottles of this incredible product, so that I am not without. I cannot say enough about MINWAX WOOD CLEANER because first of all the trigger spray bottle is user friendly and the rippled  sides of the bottle are super-easy to grip. The design of the bottle is intelligent, because your fingers easily wrap around the trigger spray bottle, making it a charm to use.  The contents, inside the bottle...the wood cleaner is something that needs to be highly advertised because this really is the cream of the crop product, for cleaning your wood. Wooden furniture and wooden cabinets are expensive and this product takes excellent care of one's wood. I do not like products that leaves a waxy, shinny, artificially coated build up that wrecks the wood. MINWAX lubricates all types of  wood and it really provides a RED CARPET feeling with regards to wood cleaning!!! Great products means great results and this is what MINWAX WOOD CLEANER IS ALL ABOUT.  MINWAX does NOT leave a coated film of any kind, which is SO VERY IMPORTANT.  I only want the best for my wood....MINWAX FLOOR CLEANER IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MY WOOD and I ONLY use MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and will NEVER use another brand.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!",60.0
19815,19816,"Can a person change?In this movie, King's Faith, Brendan King shows us how.  A troubled teen, Brendan has just gotten out of juvie and is placed in the foster home of a couple, the Stubbs, who recently lost their son, a police officer.  Mr. Stubbs' faith in God allows him to be close to Brendan right away, but his wife Vanessa is still angry and bitter after the loss of their son that she cannot find it in her heart to even try.  As Brendan assimilates to high school he finds joy in serving with other members of the Faith Club and together they decide raise money to transform Brendan's old inner-city house into a safe haven for troubled youth.  Along the way Brendan meets another troubled soul...  a homecoming queen who is not much unlike himself.  As they all work together to change the lives of inner city kids, Brendan's old gang comes skulking around determined to beat out of Brendan the location of a hidden stash of drugs.  As he refuses the gang starts bullying his friends, going so far as to run Brendan's best friend down while he was riding his bike.  With no where left to turn, Brendan fears he has no other options but to give them what they want...  Or does he?  With help from his new friends Brendan realizes that ""if you stand firm in your faith, anything is possible.""  I was on the edge of my seat wondering how Brendan was going to extricate himself from a tough situation while remaining true to his newfound faith.This movie was really good.  In the special featurrette ""behind the scenes"" the producers discuss that this was a low-budget movies, but you can't tell it.  It is very well made. Some of the acting was a little, well, corny and parts of it to me moved a little slow, but I believe this movie will resonate with teenagers and young adults.  James and I joked about how much we DID NOT miss High School while viewing this movie.  Being a teen was SO hard.  There are a lot of teens who are hurting and lost and I do notenvy anyone who is trying to be a teenager today.  Be aware that this movie is rated PG-13 unlike most movies of this genre.",46.0

19876,19877,"We looked years for a sewing table & even thought about using a normal table by raising a chair with a small step platform to get comfortable. We even went to several quitting shows & the sewing tables there went for $1000 of dollars with electric lowering sewing boards. We finally bought the Arrow Sewing cabinet because it's lowering sewing board of 7-3/8 inches wide by 17-1/2 long fitted perfectly with our Juki 2010Q sewing machine whose base is 7 inches wide by 17 inches long. The main table is made of MDF wood at 40 inches long by 19-3/4 inches wide & comes fully assembled. The two legs pull out & lock in place at 28-1/2 inches high just right for a middle size woman to sit & sew without hurting her back. The lowering chain needed to be unscrewed & put up one chain to fit the Juki 2010Q sewing machine because the adjustment screw wasn't raising the sewing board to the right level to the main table. The cut out sewing board is very poorly done & I read several other reviews in Amazon where they added sealant to protect the sewing machine & fill in the gaps between the sewing machine & the main table. I am thinking of adding a thick tape to cover the rough edges. Also the sewing board is held by a thin chain that is not centered with the adjusting screw, therefore the sewing machine maybe slightly off from level. The main table does move when you wiggle it so we thought it would shake when sewing. We tested the whole table with our Juki 2010Q sewing machine, which is a 1500 SPM straight stitching machine & ran it at full speed. The whole table surprising held up.Question: so people have to add or fix the table to their liking? I guess so at around $120.00 which makes a rating of 4. A better cut of the sewing board from the main table & 2 adjustable chains would of made a rating of 5.",44.0

19891,19892,"In The First Seventh Night (original Cantonese title - Tau Chut), a cabdriver - nicknamed 'Map King' for his unerring sense of direction and ability to find out-of-the-way places - is hired by a slightly mysterious stranger dressed in black to take him to a place called the Moon and Sun village.  This village, whic was a poor and sparsely populated little collection of houses and buildings in the middle of nowhere even years ago, is now pretty much abandoned, semi-mythical even, and though Map King's fellow cabrivers have heard of it, none has a clue just where it's supposed to be.  Upon taking the job, the driver is told by the stranger, who goes by the name of Pony, to lead the way and he'll follow along behind in his truck.  Along the way of the hours-long drive, the two converse by CB radio, and we hear quite a bit about the history of the Moon and Sun village and the rumors surrounding it.This movie is done in the general style of Hero (the Jet Li one) and The Usual Suspects, as more than one account of past events is related to the viewer by different characters.  Apparently, some great tragedy happened in the village some years back.  But what was it really, and are either of the characters, as they continue talking, really telling the full truth?  About one third of the movie takes place in the present, the rest in flashbacks that sometimes (deliberately) contradict each other.  The title of the film refers to the belief in a number of Asian religions and cultures that the spirit of a recently deceased can return to its loved ones seven days after death.If you want to find faults to take issue with, it's not that hard: the movie is limited a mite by an obviously low budget, certain special effects leave something to be desired, and a couple of moments seem to have a vaguely humorous air that I don't think was intentional.  However, focusing on those shortcomings is kind of seeing the glass as ten per cent empty rather than ninety percent full.  The movie as a whole is original and truly suspenseful, has some good frights, good acting and a very interesting angle for characterization, in the form of 'which parts of the flashbacks about any given character are right, if any'.  It's also got some unexpectedly moving scenes that might prompt a non-horror fan who enjoys dramas to take a chance on this particular horror movie.  Many Asian movies, whether horror, action, or otherwise, end up inserting a bit more of an emotional punch than one might expect.  And, as usual, these kind of elements don't interfere with other elements (like the scare factor or the mystery factor); instead the different components tend to make one another more powerful.  I haven't seen any other movie that's quite like this one, and despite the occasional shortcoming, The First Seventh Night is recommended all the way.  Four-and-a-half stars.",48.0

19894,19895,"First, I have to REALLY say that this seller is probably one of the best on Amazon. Very courteous, professional and polite. They very obviously value customer service. All of my rings are princess/emerald cut, so originally I had picked out the sqaure design version of the bracelet. When I went to order it though, it had been sold, so I bought the round cut one instead as a second choice. I was worried about the round shape clashing with the square shape of my engagement ring, but as it turned out, it looked gorgeous and didn't clash AT ALL. On a whim I contacted the seller and inquired about the square cut version that had been sold. The seller got back to me immediately and said it was sold, but if I was still interested he would order another one for me. I was totally floored. I did not think customer service existed at that level before. Within the week, the seller contacted me to tell me that he received the square version and JUST listed it on amazon. I immediately ordered it. Within 2 days my bracelet arrived. It is absolutely stunning. I have had it for a month and have not taken it off since it arrived. Wonderful service, wonderful product.....I just wish I could give this item and seller TEN gold stars!",52.0

19927,19928,"My wife has a bad back (scoliosis), so her chiropractor recommended a firm mattress. So 3 years ago we bought a nice S&F mattress, which had the support, but was too firm on the pressure points. A topper from BBB worked for a couple years, but then it must have worn out and she was getting a lot of pain again. So we tried out a number of different options, including a SN bed, a gel memory foam, this one, and a poly fill topper. The SN bed was a glorified air mattress, which did not help at all and cost as much as our king sized bedroom set. The gel memory foam did not make it out of the package, since the memory foams hadn't worked in the past. The latex was okay at first, but she didn't love it and wanted to try another one. The poly fill topper felt great at first (""like a cloud""), but was compressed by morning and the aches were back. At this point, we gave the latex another shot and after a week, realized that her back pain was gone!While I'm not picky about what I sleep on, I love the latex too. While the cost is higher than some other options, it has the perfect combination of comfort and support (and is much cheaper than a new bed). Summer is just getting started, but so far it has been as cool as anything else. The quality of this topper is the best I have seen, with a cover that makes it simple to install and rotate. The straps on the cover have no issues fitting over our extra deep mattress. A note on size: it does not extend the full dimensions of the bed, but leaves ~1"" all around to help the sheets fit.Customer service and communication from the seller is top notch.

I bought this projector brand new in April 2010 and it has been great for four years and now it is not repairable and has less than 2000 hours total.  This has been the issue with every Epson I have owned.  It seems that Epson projectors are programed to self destruct when the warantee ends in 3 or 4 years.

This time the lamp overheat lights started flashing and the projector shut itself down and it can't be repaired for less than $1000.

I haven't tried the glass breaker yet, but it seems sharp and strong enough to do the job. The recurved blade is good at pulling the work into the belly to make short work of rope and fibrous materials. Locks up like a bank vault, and the liner lock is jimped for easy disengagement.

After about 20 hours of use over multiple trips, the devise suddenly drops the carrier and the transmission ceases. I turn the unit off and then back on and the carrier and the transmission resumes. After about 1 minute it drops the carrier again. I turn it off and back on and the carrier and frequency are back on. For the next hour, this process consistently repeats about every 60 seconds. I contacted the Scosche technical people and they graciously tell me to send it back to them and they will replace it, which I do and they do.  A couple of weeks later I receive what appears to be a new FMTD3, in a new box.  I open it and put it in the car and go for a drive with my MP3 and audio book playing.

HOWEVER, this was the very narrowest coat rack I could find online and was exactly what I needed for my tiny hallway in my rented apartment. The box arrived beaten to hell. UPS had tried to tape it back together and warned me there were ""screws falling out of the box."" Great. I got it home and put it together, with the following caveats:- I had to go to the hardware store for 2 more (missing) screws- One of the pipes was bent during shipping, and I couldn't fit the pieces together. Luckily, the hardware store guy bent it back for me with a pair of pliers.- The black coating is scratched / beaten to hell in a few places. This isn't a big deal, as I plan to spray paint the whole thing white.- The bench, as other people have said, is ugly and cheap. ALSO, I could not for the life of me figure out how to secure it to the frame. It just sort of sits on top, I guess. The directions (which lacked any words, BTW) do not have any picture for attaching the seat, and there seem to be no parts for that purpose. I don't know. I'm also going to spray paint the bench and/or buy some upholstery fabric to fix it up.In sum, if you have a tiny space, this is the smallest coat rack available.

The one then was all aluminum and did an acceptable job of holding the case, but the pins were a very sloppy fit in the machined aluminum side pieces.  While the first one worked ""OK""  I got tired of crawling around looking on the floor for the pins that had fallen out.  Still not satisfied that I had a decent solution to the large watch case problem, I ordered up the Paylak large case holder from Amazon.  It's made of some kind plastic, is fairly heavy--a good thing--and is a lot larger than the previous one I had gotten from Amazon.  However just like the other one, the pins fall out.  The one advantage of the Paylak case holder is that the pins have a flat side  and don't roll as far under the benches as the other does which is a lot like saying ""for such a fat kid, he doesn't sweat much"".  In the early 21st century, it seem odd that such a simple problem has avoided solution.blues",20.0

I replaced the battery once I think (numbers started getting, and the band once (yes, you may have to call Timex to find it, but they definitely can supply it at a reasonable price). When the second band wore out, I decided to buy a new one rather than replace the band: the old one was really working fine though some of the markings on the face were beginning to fade and the face itself was slightly scratched.The second one is going strong after a couple of years. (I'm no longer wearing it during vigorous exercise as I realized that was a primary factor in causing the bands to wear out: constantly getting it wet with sweat.)It's got lots of alarms (I use three different alarms depending on the day of the week; I enable/disable them as needed), a very serviceable count-down timer, and a solid stopwatch. It also supports multiple time zones, which I use occasionally. I have used it for keeping time while refereeing soccer games: works great. Despite the prominence of the compass points on the face, I've never really used that aspect of it so won't comment on that. It also has a couple of other timers/features that I don't use; you can hide the unused features so they don't show up as you're toggling through the active ones.It's comfortable and is casual-looking which fits my lifestyle (without looking ""cheap""). The leather is easy on shirt sleeves (compared to the velcro ones: I found that the roughness of the velcro strip tended to fray my shirt cuffs over time).

Roku support was not very helpful at all. So rather than try to unload the Roku 2 to someone else (Roku wouldn't take it back and I couldn't find my sale slip to return it to Walmart), I found that Amazon had a supplier of infra-red remotes that worked with my Roku 2 player and I figured that would fix my problems. Infra-read is much older technology so I was pretty sure I would not have any problems with it. And so far I have been proven right. Since using this new infra-red remote I have had absolutely no problems using my Roku 2 player.    Now if I could only find out why the Roku 2 clock won't update, automatically or manually. So far, the clock problem has not caused me any problems with the streaming channels therefore no harm, no foul.    P.S.

There are other cookbooks one can use their common sense and adapt to gluten free, a more thorough explanation on how to do that would have been appreciated more than some non workable recipes with disappointing results for the expense of the ingredients and the time involved.4.

The first recipe I used, the pancakes with coconut flour was not remotely accurate in terms of flour/liquid proportions.  Following instructions left me with a mixture that could not be made into pancake.

There are no extra pockets etc.  It is meant for a sleeve and that is it.  No extra mag spots etc.   Heavy stitching and stings on the zipper so you can get a hold of them.    Lockable as well.    The GPS logo has Velcro on so you can remove it.    It unzips to lay flat to put your pistol on at the range which is a nice touch or you can rest your forehead on it if you need pillow!    The inside is the same nylon as the outside and the same product as all their other bags.    I bought these with the intention of putting pistols in and then putting in the range bag so not having the mag in the gun is not a big deal for my purposes.  If you are wanting to keep you pistol in bag with the mag in it, it is almost going to be too tight unless you have a derringer!      They call this MEDIUM size.

20180,20181,"It's a nice size and design to hold your small gadgets and a few chargers either in your briefcase or in your carry-on luggage while traveling. However, I expected better quality from Amazon, notwithstanding the Amazon ""basics"" designation.  The zipper seems a bit slack and as if it would not be stable with repeated use, however, that is just a guess since I haven't used it repeatedly.  The real reason I'm returning it is the strange and offensive odor.  Why on earth should this product have a strong smell that doesn't go away? I was surprised by the odor, of smoke and burned plastic. The case did not appear damaged in any way, and was sent in cardboard packaging, so the offensive odor of burned plastic had to come from the case. Maybe it was made of cheaply recycled plastic (like, melted down by someone at home)? That's all I can think of that would lead to this bad smell.  I traveled in India some years ago and saw people melting down plastic in cauldrons outside their buildings, for recycling purposes, and it smelled like this so that's all that comes to mind to explain it.  Anyway, I left it out of its packaging to air out for a few days, and as a result it made the room smell like faintly of burned plastic and smoke.  The smell of the product did not improve over several days of being open to the air. So I will return it. Last thing I want is to put it in my carry-on, and arrive at a business trip with my business suits smelling like I got them at a fire damage salvage sale.  Too bad, because the case itself is a nice design idea, with little pockets and adjustable compartments inside where I could have stashed all those odds and ends (cell phone, blackberry, small camera, etc) that all currently have their own separate storage cases.

20183,20184,"I wish I had never purchased this book. Curiosity killed the cat, and now I am guilty of helping this man out financially. At first glance it seemed to be enjoyable and a very easy read.  It won't take the reader long to see how self absorbed this man is.I'm sure that some of this is factual, however it is quite apparent that tooting his own horn is more important than anything an actor or actress can contribute. There are many instances in this book where Mr. Bowers seems to take full credit for the achievement of others. One of the most glaring is when he seems to think if it weren't for him his friend would not have won the Oscar. There are many instances like this through out the book, and it doesn't take someone too long to realize that basically this man is a huge bore.He claims to have no regrets for his life and I believe it.  A long standing marriage to an understanding spouse and the loss of a daughter don't take up too much space in this book.It's all about the pursuit of tail for either himself or all his wonderful ""friends"" in Hollywood.  Anything of any real importance seems to be thrown in as an after thought.  This is his book and it is all about him.  Stories he relates about his ""friends"" is pretty much common knowledge to the average reader. Most, if not all of his ""friends"" are no longer living, so it's his word against theirs.To sum up this book, if you want to call it that, I guess you could say his life is fairly shallow. I'm sure he probably orchestrated hook ups for celebrities in his prime. Okay, he was a pimp. What I find some comfort in is the fact that all his Hollywood ""friends"" used him  as much as he liked using others. He states many times in the book that what he did for all those years ( pimping), was to make others happy. In his own mind I'm sure he believes this. Every thing he got in this life was on the backs of others.  If these celebrities were really his friends as he emphatically states again and again, he would have kept his mouth closed.",52.0

20194,20195,"I bought my first set of AX-180s several months back. I decided to purchase the 2 year warranty for the headset, and boy am I glad I did! After hooking them up, I was pleased to be experiencing enhanced audio for my online gaming for the first time. For a 50 dollar headset, I wasn't expecting the greatest quality, but in fact, they definitely surpassed my expectations. Unfortunately, after a little over a month of use, I began having issues with the voice output on my microphone. It started with that loud blood curdling screech that only my friends could hear, following shortly after with a complete loss of voice communication on my end. Now, I understand that this happens with headsets... but that happens OVER TIME! I took the headset back to have them replaced. The second pair was much more polished (and by polished, I simply mean there were small details I noticed about this pair, that the older pair didn't have) and lasted longer... about 5 months longer. Until the same thing began to happen again (I started to see a trend), but this time, the whole left speaker went out. I was able to narrow it down to a connection issue with the left connector that hooked into the module. I decided that that was the last straw. I took them back again and upgraded to the AX-720s. I really hope that I am not just cursed when it comes to the 180s, but I really do find the 720s much better as far as performance goes. The 180s are a great headset. However, to me, you just can't really stop those small electrical malfunctions unless you're educated on fixing those problems. I hope this review was helpful.

I got one for my son a year ago and he uses it regularly. He reports it has gotten really noisy. I can report, from many years of experience with a Needak rebounder, that oil helps. But, over time, very slowly and unnoticed, microdrops of oil built into stains on the carpet. We are going to try small amounts of white (lithium) grease, instead (think Pep Boys). Eventual spring breakage and replacement is unavoidable. And, stubborn as I am, I ignore their advice and replace them only as they break; not all at the same time.I bought a Cellerciser for myself at my son's urging due to the gentleness of the rebound itself. It is far gentler, which is important if disc verterbra impact is important to you.In summary, it is the best I have experienced and would recommment it highty.

20229,20230,"Bob Gates book defines the differences between leadership styles of a military leader and a political leader.At first, you think his observations of management style differences between Presidents Bush & Obama are politically based. But with the revelations in Paneta's book and the resignation of Hagel from Gates' former position reveal the egomaniacal, micro-manager Obama is as leader.The depth of his commitment to the men and women who serve our country is undeniable, and his desire to see victory in these wars is in contradiction to the President who came into office in 2009. His philosophy was politically-based, with no concern for the service personnel or countries we were deserting. His philosophy was to appease his political constituents and own ideas.Gates presentation painted all participants in a true light, not all flattering or degrading, just personal perception. Clinton comes off well, Biden as incompetent and Obama as an amateur. With movement in the DOD recently, his insights need to be heeded.",16.0

I was very disappointed and returned the book for the following reasons...1. The recipes require so much prep! I don't have an hour in the morning to chop veggies, brown meats, etc. I want to just be able to throw stuff into a slow cooker and go.2. I'd say about 75% of the recipes contain spicy peppers. My husband can't tolerate spicy food, so most of the book was pointless for us.3. Most of these recipes also contain nightshades (tomatoes, eggplants, etc.) that, in a Paleo diet, are to be eaten in moderation due to their alkaloid content. Nightshades have been shown to increase inflammation.4.She sure talks about herself a lot. I was curious to learn more about where these recipes came from, but pretty much every page was about Arsy, how she's Armenian, and what Armenians like to eat. Having a few Armenian friends, I understand that this is part of the culture and they are very proud. I really just want to hear about the food, though.Three stars for the beautiful design.

IOW some discs may not support remaining time on the main title but things like extras may support it. If you activate remaining time in a extra, when you go back to the main title remaining will stick.Another thing I like about the NS-50 and also NS-41(basically identical to the NS-50 from what I've found) is they both have full picture controls: Brightness, Contrast, Color, etc.Like most all Sony DVD players this one has  a 6 disc resume feature that remembers where you left off for the last 6 discs where you've saved a resume(to not save a resume simply push STOP STOP before ejecting the disc). Resuming is as simple as inserting a disc and pressing PLAY or pushing PLAY when the tray is open and it will close and start at the resume point.This player has PLAY, EJECT, STOP, PAUSE and SKIP forward and SKIP rev on the main unit, other features are accessed from the remote.On the remote it has speed play where you can play a disc in anywhere from .6 to 1.4x speed with audio. Full slow motion as well as frame advance is also available, not to mention time search where you can easily enter any time and the player will jump to it.I have several of these and they seem to last forever not to mention they are quite good at playing scratched discs as well as all burnt discs including DL's.

20251,20252,"This is my first leather laptop bag, I have only used canvas-type backpacks in the past. I wanted something more professional that I could have during customer visits, and visits with senior management. I initially received the Kenneth Cole messenger bag as a present from my wife, but it did not fit my 15"" laptop, so I replaced it with the 'Show Business' model. I have used this on about 10 business trips over the last 4 months, and take it to and from work on a daily basis. It has held up very well thus far.Pros:- Very nice construction, shows no signs of detrimental wear after several months of use- Zippers and clasps are heavy-duty, do not expect them to break down- Leather quality is very good, wearing nicely, looks very professional- Fits my laptop, iPad, all cables and chargers, some pens/business cards, and a few file folders- Has a separate zippered pocket for important documents or files.Cons:- Unless the clasps are closed fully, they click very loudly when walking (minor annoyance)- The bag is difficult to open when on my shoulder due to the curvature of the zippered section. I'm concerned that over several years the curvature of the pocket will cause the fabric near the zipper to fail. This has NOT happened yet, but seems like it could over time.- There is considerably less space in this bag than my last backpack-type bag. When transitioning, I had to leave a lot of non-essential items out (however, that bag also tipped the scales at 25+ lbs in airports, so it certainly had more than it needed).Overall, I was considering a 4, but my cons are pretty minor, or are expected, not actual.

This makes having conversations very difficult if I am not using the speakerphone feature on my phone.3) The case interferes with the phones ability to adjust the display light according to the light in the room.4) Dust gets in the phone and interferes with viewing the screen.5) The headphone situation is really inconvenient (you need an adapter). Using the adapter is not only annoying, it doesn't work well. There is a lot of interference.These issues are caused by the case, not my phone. I thought that perhaps there was something wrong with my phone but I used a different case for one week and all the above issues disappeared. In all fairness it does seem to protect the phone though- I've dropped it several times and the phone is still working. I paid a lot of money to protect my phone, but did not know it would be at the expense of its' functionality.When I first purchased this product and had not yet been aware of all these issues I recommended it to a friend.

To use the mixer, make sure your voice programs (teamspeak, mumble, etc) have the Mixamp selected for both playback and recording.

20290,20291,"The game itself is brilliant and after playing the game on the Xbox One for over 20 hours I come home excited to sink more time into the game. THAT is the game side - however the console I am playing it on is so weak that it cannot carry this games empty grocery bags. Going to limit my ramblings to 3 items - Controls - Frame rate - Graphics.Controls - they changed the control scheme a little from the Witcher 2 on the Xbox 360 so that may upset some. They are slightly clunky and take some getting use to but it can be done.Frame rate - ONE WORD - HORRIBLE - the time I spent playing I always end up with watery eyes and a slight head ache. The frame rate and motion blue and resolution changes are hard on the eyes. The rate often jumps down into the 20s which feels like someone punched you right in the eyes. It's frustrating and even though its probably a little bit of optimization lack luster on the games part - the console is just to weak for this game. When you rotate the character the amount of motion blur in the draw distance is laughable, it turns into one big generic blur with no detail at all. If I didn't have a vested interest in the Gamerscore I would have not even bought this weak DDR3 all in one Xbox One. I think the frame rate drops are attributed to the dynamic resolution changes but for the love of eye sight, kill the dynamic resolution and pick a standard and stick with it. Even if its low settings its better then eye gouging frame rate stutter.Graphics - Beautiful - very detailed with overly done wind effects on trees. If they cut back on the wind effects alone I think they could have put that into the frame rate. The draw distance is immaculate but as soon as your rotate your character it disappears into a massive blur, its the worst I have ever seen.I am just an Xbox fan boy who is hating because my system of choice is such a wimp - DDR3 are you kidding me!!!",35.0

Used it while making minor repairs on my 18 wheeler, and it proved an awesome wardrobe addition. I moistened it, and stayed cool in 107 degree heat. While I would love a 46""x46"" size, due to me having a larger neck, and head. It will definitely be included in my clothing bag. After the first wash, It did not have any extensive color wash off.

I usually don't like changes in POV, and often times authors are accused of using this strategy as a cheap ""cop-out"" method when they don't know how to convey feelings of secondary characters.Well, there's no ""cop-out"" here, and book 4 delivers a much-needed break from the formulaic repetitiveness of the first three installments. I was afraid that Mira and Danaus would yet again fly to a far-away destination to prevent the Naturi from wreaking havoc. However, that was not the case here.In Pray for Dawn, Danaus is finally confronted with the being that holds part of his soul. Through various efforts, the bori tries to manipulate Danaus and Mira to set him free, so he can permanently roam the earth.A few of the characters we know make an appearance, but most of the air-time is dedicated to Mira and Danaus.Unfortunately, there were also some inconsistencies, but they can be overlooked.For one, Danaus has several strange encounters with Mira where she acts totally out of character.For example, she calls her car her ""baby"" and she makes several passes at Danaus when you least expect it.Also, some of the plot threads are repeated and some of the interior monologue gets re-hashed to bits.Despite its flaws, Pray for Dawn offers a nice change from the non-stop fighting action of the first three books.Mira and Danaus spent a lot of time together getting to know each other better as she brings him deeper into the world of Nightwalkers.",12.0

This system works and works well and is completely reliable, fast - everything you're looking for.  Don't even worry about any complexity of setup - this is just super easy to set up and it really works.  The package I got from Amazon was just a bubble wrap with the item, a short coax cable, a two-way 2Ghz splitter and a quick start guide.  If you want to plug it in as is and go it works fine. If you want to add encryption or pick a particular frequency to use, you need a setup utility that you have to download online.  I just Googled the brand and model number on the device and downloaded the setup utility with ease.  The utility is straight forward and obvious to use - you pick a frequency (I just picked SCAN) and if you want, encrypt your home signals with a numerical password.  That's all the utility does.  Not all home setups have the right kind of 2GHZ splitters throughout the house, so scan will pick a frequency for you your home wiring can handle.  If you want top speed, replace all your splitters with the 2GHz type and pick the highest frequency in the setup utility.  Can't say enough praise for this tech.  No worries.  This is the one to buy.",43.0

The older watch has the hour mark tubes positoned along the radius (center to edge of the dial) with twin tubes at 12 O'clock.

Had to often skip several pages or just barely scan them for anything worthwhile. From an American movie viewer's taste, the narrative doesn't truly come alive until Mason moves to Hollywood.Very little is told that is interesting. In fact, the author harps repeatedly about that Mason is insular and not interested in showing any emotion other than when he puts down a few co-stars. Difficult to empathize with him.The author does little to give insight into behind-the-scenes of Mason's movies. Mostly one or two sentence mentions that he did this or that. As if he read Wikipedia.  Am guessing that one will get a story if he can find the one written by Mason himself..",29.0

For the first few weeks everything was great until my wallet started beeping, I took the battery out reset it and everything was fine then it did it again and again on and off for about a week. One day I decided to see to check them to make sure they were still working properly, the good news is they could still find each other. the bad news was the range for one was only ten feet (also this finder was able to be covered and still found), the other finder could only transmit when it was six inches away and there could be nothing,  absolutely nothing in the way otherwise you could be pushing the designated button all day and never find your keys when they were a foot away tucked under a pillow.

20538,20539,"Bought this wig for a community theater play to wear for about 10 minutes onstage each day. Fantastic product! Looks just like the picture. Good price. The wig comes in a solid, hard box with netting; great for re-storage. It's thick enough and definitely does not have bald spots. The top curls are well secured with some kind of bobby pins. The side curls held up very well after two months of handling (taking it out, putting on, repackaging). It has elastic straps inside for size adjustment.Things of Note: I tried it first with just my hair pinned up. It was a little loose and the next strap adjustment notch was too tight on me. Next I tried it with a cheap wig cap which really made the wig slide around. The cap got a run after the first usage and got tossed anyway. What I found worked great for me was a pair of control top panty hose with the legs cut off and tied to make a wig cap. The ribbing texture on the hose gave the wig something to grip to and it stayed on securely and comfortably, even through some light activity (tilting head back and a slight skirmish with other characters onstage). Recommend also using a few bobby pins for extra security. The last thing any actress wants is to lose her hair onstage.The bangs are a little long and do have a tendency to get in one's eyes. The plus side is they are very thick and don't look cheap. I suppose you could trim them, however I couldn't bear to cut such a beautiful wig.",58.0

20576,20577,"So what is your Power Score?On a scale of 1 to 10 how well have you laid out the priorities of your organization and is everyone on board with them and for them.Multiply that number byOne a scale of 1 to 10 on what percentage of people in your organization are “A players”?  0% to 100%.  These are people who are in the right job and contribute positively to the organizations culture.Then multiply that number by the condition of your organizations relationship.  Relationships between employees, between management and labor, between the organization and its customers and suppliers.The perfect number you can have is 1000, but that is probably impossible.  A number of 729 means you are running at full power.  500 to 700 means you are doing pretty well.  Below 500 you need to do some work.That is the premise of the Power Score.  The book is written in a question and answer format, the authors asking the questions they believe the reader would ask and then answering them.  It actually makes for an easy read and makes it easy to explain some of their more complex thoughts.  Overall there is nothing earth shattering in this book, it all comes down to basic common business sense, the authors just organize it in very thoughtful way, and they support all of their claims with references a large pool of research they are pulling from.  They offer ideas and strategies to improve your score in all three of the categories.So I don’t think this book offers any earth shattering ideas, it is full of a lot of good ones.

We must trust God to not give us anything we can't bear through our understanding that he is always with us.This book has an excellent message, but each chapter has basically the same ideas.

In another way, the repetition can mean that the reader begins skipping through the book looking for new ideas.I recommend this book if you're searching for your meaning in life and wondering why God sent trials to you.

Menus are easy to navigate.  Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding.  2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery.  The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around.  Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell).  Secondly, it took from 2/16 until 2/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS.  Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?)  Would purchase this unit again but only if it not being shipped USPS.",29.0

He is so down to earth, so enlightening, and so willing to educate on nutrition with plant based foods. He has one award winning recipe that he shared with us and showed us how to prepare, which we then got to eat. Pistachio encrusted fillets (of Tofu)... crazy OVER the TOP!

20662,20663,"I purchased this in December and we have gotten a lot of use out of these DVD players! I recently purchased a longer AV cable because the way we configured it in the car with one player in the second row and one in the back we needed a longer cable to be able to tuck it away and not have to trip over the cord whenever the kiddos got in and out of the car. With that adjustment it works beautifully. Everything as far as the players are concerned has been working great until this last car trip one of the player's doors will not latch securely so at the slightest jar or bump it will flash ""open"" on the screen and stop playing. This is not a huge deal since we always watch with them connected anyway it just required a simple DVD swap. Like I said we use them a lot and I have four little girls under the age of 7 with access to the buttons so I'm not blaming the machine. The video quality is perfect for what we use them for, the sound is great, maybe a little too great we usually turn off the sound on the player mounted behind the driver's head and leave the other one on so my husband and I can have a conversation in the car. I am not in love with the buttons to control play and pause and skipping chapters, they are very small and it is very easy to push the wrong one and start rewinding instead of playing. As long as I set the whole movie up before we head out it is usually no big deal but as far as controlling the units themselves it's too tricky for the four year olds who are the main DVD player controllers. All in all if you are debating about purchasing this item I did some serious homework on it and am very satisfied with this purchase.

The book itself is very reasonably priced so I didn't expect anything really high quality as far as the cover, etc. However, this book looks very expensive and high quality and is a great bargain.  The pictures inside are superb and although I have not read all of the stories inside, the first few I've read give background to the photographs that make them more real and meaningful.

20756,20757,"The Philips PB9011 portable Blu-Ray DVD Player is a pretty good option for the back seat of a car, but it doesn't offer much more than less expensive players unless you are committed to Blu-Ray discs.  Pros:  - They generally do what they are supposed. They provide an ok movie watching experience for the back seat.  - 9"" screens are on the bigger side for portable players intended for the car.  - The carrying case fits everything perfectly and easily. No jamming stuff into place or having to figure out what should go where. It really is well done. With kids, it is important that things can easily be put away properly.  - As the name says, it plays Blu-Ray discs. In reality, the quality on this player doesn't allow Blu-Rays do much more than a DVD, but if you already have a Blu-Ray disc, you can still play it in the car with the PB9011. In the past, we had to limit ourselves to DVD's just in case we wanted to watch the movie in the car at some point. Nice!  Cons:  - You can only watch one movie at a time. The second screen is only a slave to the primary. The other (much less expensive) portable DVD players that we have can work as a pair or independently.  - The volume control is a physical dial on the side of the player, so it can't be controlled by remote and it requires a little more fidgeting than a digital volume control.  - The sound is ok but not great. It sounds much more like mono than stereo and doesn't get very loud without deteriorating.  - The screen washes out in sunlight. In the back seat of a car, it is tough to control going into and out of sunlight. These screens don't do well with that.  - The cables are quite a mess in the back of the car, but that is hard to avoid with a pair of portable screens.  - The remote control feels flimsy. We'll see how it holds up.  - The screens don't tilt on their backings like our other players do. If the angle is off for the person watching the movie, you have to play with how it is strapped to the headrest insteadof just tilting it up or down.",75.0

20763,20764,"A warning to all, size down at least 1 size, OK, 2 sizes.  The flattening panel in the front needs to fit you like a girdle and when it doesn't, there are pooches on both sides of it, and you, at the tummy.  Washing and drying on a hot setting doesn't do much, NYDJ recommends cold water. Washing in hot just relaxes the spandex and the shrinkage is just temporary from the cotton shrinking. I was also disappointed that they were NOT Skinny. Slim, yes, but not what I expected.  I couldn't return them because the return policy states that you can't open the package to try them on, and expect to return them. The one good thing is that NYDJ positions the back pockets closer together and this is more flattering on your rear.

20773,20774,"A rep from the Artless Dodges Press contacted me about a review for this book and gave it a chance and hoped for a little different reading material after finished school. It was definitely different and something I would never read again or even recommend.I found myself just waiting for something big to happen and actually get the book going and then I looked down and realized I was two-thirds of the way done and nothing had happened, there was no plot. The main character, David, complained and complained and I wanted to throw the book at him. His girlfriend was equality annoying and the one time I was excited is when she finally discovered her backbone towards the end.Personally, I think it came down to the stylistic choices by the author that I couldn’t get behind. The writing is very spacey and clunky. Most of the story was pure dialogue. I missed the descriptive language and adjectives to make me feel like I’m in the book with the characters. I imagine this could be something you could adjust to but I couldn’t get my head around it, I felt like I was reading someone’s diary instead of a book.In the end it’s a very particular book that wasn’t too my liking, but maybe at 21 I’m just too optimistic about life and growing up to appreciate such “realism.”",22.0

20778,20779,"I have been an avid Amazon shopper for many years, but this is the first product I am writing a review for, because of how impressed I am with the shoe.  First off, I have had fairly extensive knee problems for many years, and have had eleven surgeries, gone through hours of physical therapy for these and for ITB syndrome, etc.  To some degree the fact that I continue to be a runner is maybe a bit hard-nosed and stubborn, but I love it too much to think about giving it up.  I've tried various shoes (about 12 different pairs of runners in the past three years alone), various knee braces/apparatus/sleeves, and varied running environments from rubber track to road to trail.  I've always been an Asics guy, but have also tried New Balance, Adidas, Brooks and Nike.  I've always tried to find a shoe with extra cushion, thinking it would absorb impact rather than distributing it to my knees.  This is my first Mizuno product, which I decided to try after my Uncle recommended the brand to me based on his love for the Wave Riders; I was a bit leary, having tried multiple shoe brands, and decided on these Wave Creations based on his, and other reviews.  This shoe does NOT offer my heel that super cushiony feel yet gives me the support I need to run pain-free, even days after my runs.  I've begun to think that, like my sleep number bed, which I inflate to a more firm setting when I have back pain, that perhaps my thinking with shoes has been wrong all along, and that the more firm shoe is actually offering me more support in a similar manner.  If you're like me, and have been continually frustrated with knee/ITB difficulties, consider this shoe; it may not be for everyone but it's done wonders for me.  I have a high arch and am an under pronator; I am 5'11"" and at the time of this writing weigh an even 200 lbs.  I recommend purchasing this shoe in a 1/2 size larger than your regular sneaks, but then I recommend the same for any running shoe as it had been advised to me by a professional several years ago and I've always stuck with that.",36.0

Good luck with the remote too - you have to be a yoga expert to control the thing.  The case doesn't fit it properly either, so if you hit a bump, the velcro won't hold it back and it'll flip forward.  I hate it.  I guess I'll be trying out the warranty, but guess what?  I replaced a Sylvania with this one, and that one also broke after a few months.  We follow installation instructions to the letter.  i thought this one might be different because of its decent reviews, but it was worse.  I suspect Sylvania paid for the good reviews on this item.EDIT:  Customer service on the warranty was awful.  AWFUL.  You have to pay to shipping and handling to return it, and $7 for them to return it to you.  And you get to speak with someone not in this country, who will make you repeat everything 150 times.

20843,20844,"I've worn Rainbows for years.  When I lived in a warmer area, I wore them pretty much every day, all day.  The shoes would last about 9-10 months.  The best part is I never had the thong part rip out and leave me barefoot, which is the common frustration with flip flops.  I only replaced them when the padding started to wear out and not protect my heals.The double layer makes these extra comfortable, but you need to realize that rainbows must be broken it.  They are like a pair of leather boots in that they're uncomfortable until broken in.  Once that happens, they are perfect.  I recommend getting the sandals wet and walking around in them to help speed up the break in.This pair, for whatever reason was about .25 inches longer than the other pairs I've had in the same size.  They're almost too big, but it hasn't been a problem.  I might end up trimming them.",27.0

Some programs are in HD and mostly the rest at at 720/480 lpi. The remote is not very responsive and there is a delay. I would also like to see if they can allow Android Karaoke. I tried to down load it but there is an error message. ""This is not compatible application for your device"".For $170 I think it is worth it. Esp. if you like HK Cantonese sitcom and variety show.

20848,20849,"I purchased from Walmart for $250($268 after tax). Took me about 10 minutes to hook everything up -- sat back on the couch for an hour listening and adjusting levels with different movies/music. The system looks clean and goes well with my 46 inch Samsung. The remote that came with the speakers worked with my TV right out of the box -- and I like it better than my stock TV remote so I'll be using the new one from now on. I also like the USB plug on the right side of the bar so I can plug my phone in to charge or listen to music. I've been listening to music/movies for the last 4 hours and here's what I've noticed so far...Low Levels - Since the sub is so weak, you'll have to turn the sub to the highest setting if you really want to feel it in your bones. And when you crank a speaker up to the highest volume, you almost never get a clean sound. It's not HORRIBLE, but I feel like SAMSUNG really could have satisfied people a lot more if they included a more powerful sub. For movies it's not so bad, but the bass isn't crisp and sharp with songs that have a lot of kicks or 808's with low frequencies.Mids/Highs - The range of the actual sound bar itself is incredible...there's a real distinction between the mid/lower and highest frequencies which are all driven out at different angles so they hit your ears to closely resemble a 5.1 system. I did notice slight clipping noises when the upper range hit higher volumes though -- hopefully this will go away after the speakers get broken in. The sound really is beautiful though and I'm happy with the look/sound of the bar.I'll definitely enjoy these for now but I'm not impressed with the sub. I'm waiting for Vizio to release their new system which is supposed to be the next best thing since sliced bread. I'll compare the two and pick whichever ends up sounding better...but for now the E450's will be a huge upgrade from my stock TV speakers.",40.0

Believe me, paying less than 290.00 (which included free shipping and for some reason no sales tax was added) The picture has been crystal clear, sound quality is good (did purchase SONY sound bar system at the same time with the money I saved) Set-up was ridiculously easy (in my bedroom) and sha-zam! Apps have worked great so far, no problem with Netflix.

20850,20851,"Purchased this to replace an aging 42 inch Panasonic Plasma.  The Plasma has been great but this new Vizio is absolutely amazing.  The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I've owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won't be sorry.UPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a ""pop"" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.The second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.I did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.  We shall see.",74.0

I used these shoes in a rotation with three others and did not expect them to wear out as fast as they did.  I could see if worn daily that some issues would arise but this was unexpected and am very dissatisfied.,8.0

These shoes are liking having 4WD for your feet when ascending and descending, steep, slippery, muddy slopes which is exactly what they've been bred for. I like them better than my Salomon SpeedCross 3's for OCR's because of the Fellraisers lower drop and more stable base. For regular trail races, I prefer my SpeedCross 3's. I can't recommend these enough if you are planning to use them for Mud Runs. If you're just looking to run gravel and relatively smooth, non-tehcnical trails, you may want to look at a shoe that may provide a bit more comfort as the ultra aggressive lugs on the Fell Raiser don't necessarily lend the shoe to the softest of feels, but they are still adequately cushioned.",19.0

These will fit tight when they arrive, as they are meant to stretch and conform to your foot. After weeks of wear, these still look great.

20987,20988,"It's tough to find a good pair of sunglasses. After going years with cheap $20 pairs, I decided to look for a good upgrade and spend a bit extra. Well, this pair is near flawless. Great design - a lens that's large enough to not bother your peripheral vision, yet not too large to cover up your face. The sides are thick, so you get a bit of privacy from people viewing you from the side (i.e. when you take a nap on the bus.) Also, something to note is the way it sits on your face, obviously there are different shaped faces, but for me, the glasses sit far enough away so it doesn't press on your cheeks when you move your mouth or smile. The contact points are the sides of the ear and bridge of the nose - perfect. They also have a nice green tint to them, very subtle and providing a good amount of shading. They're also polarized, which adds to the cost, but increases the benefit. They also come with a large case, a little minus because it's so large, but they're specifically made for these so they won't get bent or crushed. Give these a try, I think you'll be quite happy you did.",39.0

My calfs are only 12 inches, so these boots fit better then the SW 5050 boots, which have a 14 in circum.The only reason I am not giving these boots five stars is that even with jeans and boot socks, these boots are still slightly loose on me. I really wish there was a narrow calf option with an 11 or 12 inch circum. so that I could get a more fitted look.I highly recommend these boots! I can't wait to wear them!
