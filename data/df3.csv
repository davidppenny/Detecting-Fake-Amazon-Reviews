10020,10021,"[[VIDEOID:moH9TNGHOUVMA]]I wanted to show my girl setting thi up right out of the box so everyone can see what we did (though she looks cuter than me so she is the star!) you can hear the sound and check it out in full. I dig this amp- i think it could be easily used for a pro setup in a bar for karaoke where u don't want a dedicated system but are just adding somethng it. Nice mics, cool looking and super bright screen. For my money it would be hard to beat for functionality. It's been a few weeks using it now and so far we are super pleased.",17.0
10021,10022,"I love this bag. Lots of room, and looks great. It really needs more pockets. There's only one side pocket and a place for sunglasses. But the main problem is it stinks. I know it's the leather, but maybe it's the quality of the leather because the smell hasn't toned down in the 6 weeks that I've had it.",18.0
10022,10023,My hubby is in love with the case that these comes in. He's been playing guitar for over 30 years and says these are really good quality. They have all sizes covered and have nice designs on them. You push the top down to open and push sides together to close on the case. Awesome quality product!,19.0
10023,10024,This watch is so gorgeous! The pictures do not do it justice. When it came I was amazed at the quality for under $50. The crystals on the face look like huge diamonds and are so sparkly. This won't be my last Wristology watch!,15.0
10024,10025,"I've tried a couple of other IPAD ""purses"" that ended up so heavy I couldn't carry them on my shoulder. This one is light enough to put the IPAD in, and a few necessities, and not be uncomfortable.",4.0
10025,10026,"Accessories are my guilty pleasure and I have some very expensive pieces, as well as some very inexpensive pieces.  As soon as I saw this particular piece, I had to have it for work.  I generally use my inexpensive pieces for work, as I am a teacher and it is amazing how quickly clothing and bracelets/watches can get damaged in the classroom.The watch arrived promptly, before the estimated shipping date, and was packaged really well.  Upon opening the package, I was surprised by the lovely quality of the watch - especially at the excellent price.  It was a lovely, matt gold colour and quite decently weighty.  The diamonds just add a nice touch of glamour.  In fact, I have had lots of compliments about this watch from friends who have thought it was a more expensive brand.My only criticism would be the size of the strap - it is huge!  Although, it is quite easy to take a couple of links out - so it is not a huge criticism.Overall, I would highly recommend this watch to anybody looking for a fashion piece at a reasonable price.",29.0

10030,10031,"I have spent hours on this game, such a great balance between races. I hope the next game in the saga works as well, Im looking forward to buying it, too. I wish there was a version for every mac OSX, because I think they're only allowing Mavericks. Excellent game though.",13.0
10031,10032,"This bag is AMAZING!!! This is a perfect gift for men! Love it.High quality leather and the color is great. I bought it as a gift for a friend, who absolutely loves it. The cross-body style keeps it out of his way, unlike a traditional backpack using one strap. Super stylish and masculine. Very highly recommended.",25.0

10033,10034,"This is an FPS that people will love for the sole reason that it is an FPS. There's some backstory of course and the single player is pretty solid, but it's the multiplayer you want! There are so many options and play styles that you are not going to run out of things to have fun with!",10.0
10034,10035,This is a great bag have used it 3 times since I got the delivery so far it remain strong. The bag is easy to clean just a duster and you are good to go. It is actually a Lightweight travel bag very good for short travels. My hubby used it every weekend when going to the gym. He used it more even though I bought it for my own use. I plan to buy another color to make the collection 2.VOCHIC did a nice job on this bag and I must confess this bag is one of the best lightweight bags have used so far.,25.0
10035,10036,"My son loves watches and he loves to hang out at the swimming pool, apparently it is where the girls also hang out. As such, he needed a water proof watch that was also, as he puts it, cool. So, this digital watch was ideal and it is water resistant to 99 feet, which is more than sufficient for any depth that my son will be swimming to.However, a friend of my husbands is an amateur diver and he has a watch like this one to go scuba diving, so it musts stand up to that level of the sport. It has only basic features such as an alarm and timer but what more does a thirteen year old by need with his watch? It does have a small nightlight so he can read the time when it is dark, hand to remind him what time he needs to be back home for. A great watch for a great price.",21.0
10036,10037,I love having these strings for back up just in case one of mine snaps. I've been using these as my regular strings and they sound incredibly good. It was pretty cheap too so I got no complains here.,10.0
10037,10038,"Super sound quality every time with every one of these microphones.  A better sound then I would have even thought.  They turn on easily enough and set up just as simply as can be.  In fact, with these microphones, I am able to set up so fast that it is astounding, really.",14.0

10041,10042,"It took me 10mins overall to apply these screen protectors, but it was well worth my time because they are great and fit like a custom made glove. These 10 long minutes are due to the fact that I abhor dust and air bubbles (so much so that if there is one spec I can see and can't fix I will remove the whole thing and use another one), therefore, I meticulously cleaned both screens, which took the majority of the time. The instructions do seem complicated but if you take the time to look at the pictographs you'll be fine.Basically adhere the protector to your device, grab the protruding end on the right, slowly pull away towards the right, remove air bubbles with the cheap cardboard ""tool"" they give you (or a credit card), peel off the secondary layer and remove any excess bubbles.If you take the time to make sure everything's dust free you won't regret this purchase. And since you only get one shot I wouldn't rush it, not for $9 bucks a pop.",11.0
10043,10044,"Well, The picture looks more classy than it looks with mine. Still I love it and I hope that this item will last long.",7.0
10044,10045,Totally happy! A little beast. Compare the sound to my Peavey audition practice amp but with twice the punch.It's sort of comparing apples to oranges since this is rechargeable and handles voice but it has good electronics and won't clip out if it's pushed hard.,12.0
10045,10046,Looked high and low for an affordable and comfortable boot as I work in education and on my feet all day. Found these and couldn't be happier. They arrived 3 days earlier than expected as well.,8.0
10046,10047,"I'm loving this, so adorable! My daughter is 7 months but her feet seem to be a bit on the small side. These fit her perfectly they do tend to slip off occasionally though. I think these will be perfect for others as well.",14.0
10047,10048,I stumbled upon these on Amazon recently while shopping for luggage tags for men. These are wonderful to put on your luggage while traveling. I picked red as I thought it would stand out on our black luggage. It did just that!!! We used them this week for a plane trip and we *immediately* saw our suitcases when they appeared on the luggage turnstile in our destination city.,15.0

10049,10050,"This was one of the cheaper mics on Amazon. Item was delivered quickly using Prime, and connected it up easily to my PC. Worked first time!

10052,10053,"I bought this on my first hiking adventure and I didn't regret it in buying this ""Everest Hiking Pack"". The materials used on this product are very durable. I and my friend can attest on this on the multiple major scratches during our trails but it didn't cut off.  What I love most on this backpack is that with affordable price you can buy it and you have a bag that can fit clothes for days. More adventure to come with my mighty hiking pack!",16.0
10053,10054,Top quality craftsmanship in top quality leather. Is comfortable on the shoulder or in the hand. Sits perfectly upright on metal feet. I have paid 2-3 times this much for similar quality leather bags. Highly recommend.,21.0

10055,10056,This was the first game (to my knowledge) that utilized both the left and right analog sticks to move. When you had to row the boat with both sticks...I was blown away. Awesome game.,10.0
10056,10057,This bag is the perfect size for all the stuff I carry on a daily basis. The leather is nice and I love the detachable longer strap. My only complaint is the cell phone pocket on the outside as well as on the inside are too small. Smart phones seem to be getting bigger and I wish they would start making his bags with larger cellphone pockets.,12.0
10057,10058,"It's a nice cable, works well and the length is very good, very happy with the item, it can also charge the phone or tablets, so I use it for that too.",4.0
10058,10059,I got this as a gift from my hubby. I was surprised when I got this because I did not expect anything from him on independence day. He gave this as a peace offering and I really love this pair of shoes. I am fat and I used this shoes everyday. I always exercise 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon. Very comfortable to use!,19.0
10059,10060,"First and foremost, install the Linux firmware onto the box.  XBMC on Linux is a much better experience than the android APK.  I was able to install my favorite video add-ons, repositories, programs, and skins with no issues.  1080p video playback is smooth with no stuttering or buffering.  Recommended for those who are looking for a cheap solution to having XBMC in their living room (or any TV).",13.0

10064,10065,"I'm not a gamer, but my son is and he just loves these headphones. Why not, he can shut me out and really immerse himself in his games. Which may or may not be a good thing. I limit him to an hour a day after he's done his homework and that seems to be working okay.However, gaming isn't all these headphones are about. I use them for listening to my iTunes playlist while I'm writing in the early hours of the morning. The sound is sublime, nice deep bass  and perfect trebles. With these I immerse myself in my music and my writing while my family sleeps. So these headphones get five stars twice, once from me, once from my son.",24.0
10065,10066,This was a great replacement for my original xbox One adapter which blew out 1 week after my warranty expired go figures. It is definitely the same quality if not better than the original which was important. It is definitely a bigger power unit as the fan is slightly bigger than the original it seems. Great buy!,16.0
10066,10067,Bought one for my dad's birthday. I liked it so much I just had to have one myself so I bought two. Both of us love our pocket watches. Why not buy two yourself and give one away to someone you think would like it just as I did.,13.0

10070,10071,"This watch is an excellent example for the cost. I really am surprised by some of the reviews when you consider how cheap the watch is, for the price you pay this is excellent. It has all the regular watch features you would find in a more expensive watch such as a daily alarm, hourly chime, EL backlight, unidirectional bezel, dual time display, timer, and date function.It does also come in a variety of colours which is something that cannot be said of its expensive counterparts. These watches are supposed to be imitations of much more expensive watches and they do a god job, they are fashionable and sturdy.If you are after a perfect watch then this not the watch for you, however, if you are after a stylish and affordable watch that really looks the part then this is the one for you.",12.0
10071,10072,"I love this Glass Infuser Water Bottle by Dr B Goods! It is a high quality glass which is healthier to drink from than plastic. Also, you can use either hot or cold beverages with it. I love the protective silicon sleeve. That gives an extra added layer of protection to the glass and also your hands. The flip top lid is good and secure. So far I have used it to make different flavors of fruit water. I often puts lemons in it because that is so healthy. I have also used strawberries and even frozen berries. This is a great product and I am very happy I made the purchase.",35.0

10073,10074,"Shoes are good, comfort and fit correctly. The lace loosens many times a day by normal walking pressure and you have to tie it multiple times. The lace has already started fraying at the eyelets in effort to tie them tightly.",10.0
10074,10075,These cubes are so awesome. I bought them because I needed new ones to take with me on my summer vacation this year. They can hold tons of stuff for me and my family. I was able to pack everything and organize it well with these cubes.,14.0

10076,10077,"This mic stand is by far the best one I have ever worked with. I have bought so many from local stores for almost 2x the price. This one not only comes cheaper, and its sturdier! Easily adjustable and the boom is good length.",14.0
10077,10078,"I am surprised to see so many people raving about this watch. As soon as I took it out of the box I knew I wasn't going to keep it- I knew it was plastic when I ordered it, but I didn't expect it to look like plastic -I thought it would be more like ceramic or something.",6.0
10078,10079,This checkbook cover is absolutely beautiful.  It attracts attention whereever I go and use it.  Bit of a tight squeeze but worth it for the beauty you pull out of your purse everytime you write a check.,12.0
10079,10080,I am super satisfied with this bag. Helps  me to keep everything separate especially with a deep pocketbook with no compartments. Will probably purchase extras for gifts this coming christmas.  I think many will benefit from this bag as it is really a great organizer.,13.0
10080,10081,"I was a little sceptical buying the Coby brand but I have to admit I am glad I did. I bought this Coby for my treadmill. It fits perfectly were the book holder is.

10082,10083,"The watch is obviously not a high quality watch but it looks nice.  For the price and solely for the looks, I would say it is worth the 15 buck but there is no way i'd pay more than that for it.",4.0
10083,10084,I bought other glasses that are a little smaller and they are adorable. I went for the larger and they are a little fly eyeish on. Theylook beautiful in hers. My husband started cracking up when he saw me in them. I will keep them because they are fun,18.0

10090,10091,"The concept of the watch is great and looks great in the pictures, however, it looks cheap in real life.  Its a ok watch if you are in your early 20's or younger, but I don't think it fits in the professional world.",8.0
10091,10092,"play station is like the best invention ever, after Nintendo 64 of course. the gaming graphics are the best and i really couldn't be happier than having this type of gaming consoles, i bought mine on black Friday which really doesn't make a difference in the price but well it makes myself looked i spend less.the graphics are so much better with the HDMI cable, and if you have the HDMI you don't need to plug in the AV cables, and the best of using the HDMI is that if you turn on the console from the controller the TV will change itself to HDMI and the same when turning it off, it will turn itself to the channel it was (whatever you were using).i like ps3 better than XBOX because online is free and because the controllers feel more comfortable the controllers also are much better because they don't weight as much as the xbox controllers. the ps3 slim is a lot thinner than the ps3 before, that is the only difference, i really can't wait for the ps4 to be released, i heard is in october or somewhere around there so i can't wait for it. highly recommended. but i must warn you that you should wait for the ps4 which will be a lot more better than this one.",20.0

10093,10094,"For the money, this guitar looks and plays great. Tuning is a little tricky, but it comes with a halfway decent tuner to help you along at first. My suggestion, though would be to pick up a better one at your earliest convenience. The guitar plays really well, and sounds pretty decent through the little amp that's included. If you should hear any buzzing, though, the recommendation is that you take it to your nearest Guitar Center or music store and have a professional look it over. It might need a little bit of adjustment. Other than that, it's worth it if your just starting out.",26.0
10094,10095,I was amazed to see this Samsonite Luggage here...I had it almost 2 years already and I still don't feel the need to look for a new one...it is very useful and durable...just imagine how long 2 years are for this bag to endure it and I travel a lot...I recommend it to everyone.,4.0
10095,10096,"A beautiful piece that hangs proudly on our wall. However, I think it's important to note that the piece was not signed, as others indicated. And, though many have discussed the handwork, by our eyes, this appears to be at least partially stamped. It is silverfish with a bronze tone over it, so the color will vary depending on how much and what kind of light shines on it.",13.0
10096,10097,Strong and weighted nicely just like a sturdy stand should be. I've used mine already (broken down and set up) 4 times and it's holding up with no major issues.

10097,10098,"A very affordable yet awesome package from Yamaha. If you're just beginning to play, I would recommend this. It definitely it won't outgrow you and it's great keyboard for it's price. Lot's of useful freebies.",15.0
10098,10099,"My son got this as a birthday present and this review is based solely on his happiness and reaction once he got it. He was so excited! He instantly ran around the house shouting at the top of his lungs to illustrate his excitement. After thanking me profusely and eating his dinner, he dove right into playing and I think he made it a goal of his to finish in a week or something. Glad I found it here on Amazon so reasonably.. I really loathe Wal-Mart and just about any store really. So yeah thanks Amazon! Keep rocking!",31.0
10099,10100,"This is turning out to be the best Christmas gift I got. I'm big and so I like them big, it fits me perfectly. You might want to look ahead if you're too small because this is really bold but just awesome if you like it big...",11.0

10110,10111,"I held off purchasing this mouse because I was skeptical that a 40 dollar mouse could sway me not to buy a razer or a steel series gaming mouse. I was wrong. This mouse is hassle free. Extremely comfortable. Easy to use and set up. The software is simple even for non gamers to set up and manage. The clicks sound and feel great. The tracking is superb. The adjustable weights are perfect. There is nothing I can say bad about this mouse. If you are looking for a gaming mouse with out al the bugs or the high price? Get this one! You will NOT be sorry! Been using it for over a month now and I game hard with it. Shooters, mmorpg's, stratedy games, you name it. Cant make this mouse lag out or miss a shot and the easy to click dpi helps you zero in on your selected/intended target very easily. Buy with confidence that it will last you a very long time and that you will be able to use it for any application. Oh....one more thing...I have not found a surface that this mouse wont track on. I even stuck it on my head with all the hair and it still didnt miss a beat lol. BUY IT!",57.0
10111,10112,"Besides the excellent sound quality, the ability of the G3 receiver to scan the local signal environment and choose the best open frequencies is a tremendous benefit. It helps avoid dropouts caused by interfering local signals. And to top it off, once the receiver's frequency is chosen it's a snap to sync the transmitter's frequency to it. A terrific product!",15.0
10112,10113,"The projector, as delivered, required very little re-calibration. The picture is nice and bright and the 3D delivers as expected. Those who are disappointed in the 3D should look the source material as the culprit. I was very satisfied with my old one but it was only 720p and no 3D processing. This unit step it up for a few notches with brightness, resolution and reliability.",15.0

10115,10116,"My son is now an intermediate clarinet player. He even got his clarinet here! http://amzn.to/1BOijHQWe have been using the Vandorens for a while, and we will most likely stick with them. The unfortunate thing is that the quality of the reeds vary greatly from one reed to another, even within the same box of 10 reeds. This is not unique to Vandorens but with all the other reeds too, from what I hear from expert level players.To deal with varying quality of the reeds, what we have been doing is opening up several reeds at a time, then putting them in a cup of warm water, then having my son play with them for several minutes at a time. Inevitably he can pick out which reeds play the best immediately. Then we label these reeds by marking the back of the reed with a sharpee 1, 2, 3 or 4 stars. We would do this over time with all 10 reeds until all the reeds are categorized. What we have also learned is that over time, some reeds take a bit of ""breaking in"" period, so it may have to be upgraded from a 2* to 3* or 4*, and other previously highly rated reed may be downgraded over time.Pick up some of these and you'll be happy! http://amzn.to/1GNce4U",31.0

10120,10121,"I just purchased this TV from Costco last night. If anything of substance changes, I'll take the time to post an update.  I had this Sharp TV for about a month now, and so far I have been pretty pleased with my purchase. This is my second Sharp TV. The reason I also bought this 40"" is because I've been really pleased with this Sharp here: http://fave.co/1cwFHFn  Things worthy of note: - It is much more convenient to be able to watch digital media directly on the TV than it is to have a Roku, Chromecast or Wii. They are fine devices and you should probably check them out regardless for their extra features, especially the Chromecast if you're getting a different TV. Roku   http://fave.co/1cgU0wU Chromecast    http://fave.co/1cwzERc Apple TV http://fave.co/1cgYiof  - My remote came with the three programmed buttons of Amazon Instant, Netflix and iHeartRadio. Obviously I would prefer them to be Netflix, Hulu Plus and HBOGo, but I suppose that you can't please everyone. It would have been nice if you can reprogram them to your desired channels. - BIG CON: There is a buzzing noise that comes from our TV when it's on. It's quiet enough that you don't hear it when you're watching anything with sound, but when there isn't sound, it can be heard even from the other room. This might be a defect with my specific TV. I will update this review if the noise stops or changes. - The picture and sound are great for my purposes. - Our router/modem happens to be right next to our TV stand, so I do have a wired connection set up. I notice it being slightly faster in load times than wireless, of course, but it doesn't make a huge difference. - I think the TV is worth the money, but I think that I'll return mine to Costco if the buzzing doesn't go away. - I also posted this review on Costco's website, FYI.  It was not a big surprise to me that this TV also works like it should! In one word the TV works great. The picture quality is lovely, the sound is decent (and can be upgrade with a sound bar), and I don't have any daily problems or complaints about it. The remote is a little cheap as others have mentioned, but it works just fine for me, and has a simple layout that is easy to use. This is a smart TV so it has a few preloaded apps and ability to connect to the internet. I had difficulty actually launching and using any of the apps other than the Netflix app, but I have a console to run most of my apps so I found these features pretty good.  In the end I recommend you get yourself this TV. It's worth it. http://fave.co/1cwFVw2",82.0

10153,10154,"Mortal Kombat X - Xbox One From a gameplay perspective, Mortal Kombat X easily eclipses everything that's come before it. NetherRealm has taken all that they learned in the making of 2011's Mortal Kombat and Injustice: Gods Among Us to create an MK experience to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans.  The ""Kollector's"" Edition gets good marks too and in addition to the game you also get a Scorpion Figurine by Coarse, Certificate of Authenticity, Gold Scorpion Skin and Kombat Pack Downloadable Content. It might be worth checking out here:  http://fave.co/1c3tmZ7  Mortal Kombat X does play well. Moving back to 2D combat was the best move for Mortal Kombat after some clunky efforts at 3D play from a couple of generations ago, as it has allowed the team to focus on linear combos and giving the attacks a brutal characterisation behind them.  Balancing is good, though it won't take long for each player to find their favorites. I personally became accustomed to Cassie quickly. Partly because I didn't want to be on the receiving end of the ball busting move, but also because she's quick and her attacks have good flow to them. I found the bigger, heavier characters to be almost unmanageable in how clunky their attacks flowed together, but of course the first time I jumped online I ran into someone who showed me what those characters were capable of (and left me with a shredded Cassie to show for the lesson).  It remains a very accessible fighting game, with relatively small move lists for each character, though at the start of each battle it's possible to select from three different ""stances”, which effectively means that each character is three different play styles in one.  The complete list of characters in the game, some of which are classics include: Baraka, Bo' Rai Cho, Cassie Cage, D'Vorah, Daegon, Ermac, Erron Black, Ferra & Torr, Fox, Frost, Fujin, Goro, Jackson Briggs, Jacqui Briggs, Jason Voorhees, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kotal K'etz, Kotal Kahn, Kuai Liang, Kung Jin, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Nightwolf, Predator, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Sareena, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shinnok, Shujinko, Sindel, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Kurtis Stryker, Suchin, Takeda Takahashi, Tanya, Taven, Tremor  In short I'd recommend picking yourself up a copy of:  http://fave.co/1c3tyHJ",35.0

But with this one you save $100 over the non-refurbished price tag http://fave.co/1bLffXC  The VIZIO E400I-B2 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED kicks the pants of many LCDs that cost a lot more. Employing minimal zones and actual LEDs (to bring down costs) and much-improved dimming logic, the E series achieves truly remarkable black-level performance. The rest of its picture is also plenty good, and its price is simply phenomenal.  And comparing it to other TV's on the market, Vizio's E series doesn't hold a candle to the picture quality of a great plasma like this one http://fave.co/1c3T3sw  But again, look at that price tag...  Here are the 2 adjustments I'd recommend: --Go to Picture>Advanced Picture then set the BLACK DETAIL to HIGH to get those rich blacks. The default is OFF which I don't understand -- why have a great feature like this then bury it in the settings and turn it off? --Right below Black Detail is BACKLIGHT CONTROL. The default is ON -- turn it OFF. I think it's a mode that saves a tiny bit of power but looks awful with the backlight always fluctuating. It might save 3¢ per month so yeah turn it off.  I like to keep things simple so I found these picture settings to be just dandy: Backlight - 35 Brightness - 35 Contrast - 95 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Auto  OR these settings: Backlight - 50 Brightness - 50 Contrast - 50 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Autoce Black Noise - LowFilm Mode - Auto",35.0

Running Linux XBMC seems to offer a much smoother experience than the android version and is highly recommended.  Installation of 3rd party video addons and the syncing of my media libraries was quite easy.  A keyboard is recommended for the set up process as it would save time (typing network passwords or adding sources).The XIOS plays everything I have in my library without stutter over the network (H.264, WMV, AVI, MKV, MPEG, RMVB, MOV, FLV files up to 1080p over a wired connection).  The box is not your standard plug and play media player and will require a little bit of set up to get the most out of the unit.

10262,10263,"SUMMARYLove it, with some minor nitpicks; a much better experience compared to using my Wii for Netflix. Seriously save some cash and get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S8J2BXYSETUPEasy-peasy. Choose language, sign in to network, create an account. Done in 5 minutes.- Minor bug: my wireless network SSID was listed twice.- Minor gripe: had to give my credit card number, but roku.com indicated that I can remove this later via website.USEOverall, the experience is great. The interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. The remote is simple, responsive, and has great range. Previously, I used my Wii to access Netflix, but the remote range was so small that I had to get up off the couch to control the Wii. With the Roku remote I can control things even from the dining room!One potential point of confusion is the integration with M-Go. The top level menu has Channels (Netflix, Amazon, Crackle, etc) AND ""Movies"", ""TV"", etc. At first I thought that ""Movies"" might mean all movies across all of Netflix, Amazon, etc, but that's not what it is. The ""Movies"", ""TV"" and other selections are actually sub-headings for M-Go, a new Roku partner. I guess as a partner they get premium placement at the top menu level. It's not a big deal, but it was a little unclear to me.+ Interface is clean, bright, sharp (at least with my HDMI connection) and intuitive.+ Remote range is much better than Wii+ Everything feels pretty snappy.- Minor gripe: Rewind seems very small (7 seconds?)- Minor gripe: Backarrow button sometimes doesn't work and you need to use the home button.CHANNELSWhen you setup the Roku you are prompted to select from some 20+ channels. I found out that there are actually more than 1000 channels available! You can see them on [...] Just to give you an idea of how the channels work (i.e., free vs subscription vspay-per-use) I categorized my initial channels below. One way Roku could improve the channel experience would be to aggregate movies across all channels you're subscribed to, subdividing into pay-vs-free so that you'd have essentially one ""Roku channel"" that de-duplicates movies. The result would be something like TV.com which shows movies and which channels host each one.Subscription- Netflix ($8/mo)- Amazon Instant Prime Video (included with $79/yr Amazon Prime)- HuluPlus ($8/mo)Free- Crackle (with commercials)- Disney (mostly trailers/commercials, but some actual content)- Fox News (with commercials)- PopcornFlix (commercials)- PBS Kids- WSJPay-per-use- Blockbuster ($4/movie, has trailers, 4784 videos)- Vudu ($4/movie)Get this, you'll thank me later. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S8J2BXY",69.0

10270,10271,"I want to first clarify some points others have been making in the reviews on this TV. It IS indeed 120hz, the person who left that review obviously had no idea what they were talking about. I've seen people dock it stars for the lack of smart functionality. This is not a smart TV. It has a basic,navigable, and responsive menu. I have also seen docked stars for lack of ports. The site plainly lists how many ports the TV has, it's your own fault if you expected it to have more.I have something plugged into every port on this TV, except the USB port (I have no need).Xbox 360 plugged into the Component inputs (old style 360), WD Media Player into 1 HDMI, and a future HDMI cable already run for my future Xbox One. I also have standard coax cable hooked up to this TV as well. This is all I need the TV for, which is why I went with this one vs a TV with more options since budget was an issue.I haven't yet tweaked with the picture settings yet, but plan to and I hope to update this review when I do.Pros:-Beautiful display. My friends have commented on it's sharpness, color, and thin bezel. Minimal glare, if any in my setup.-Absolutely perfect response time. I am a very heavy gamer, and this works great for FPS and fast response games. If you plan on using this for any game console, this is your TV.-Absolutely no 'soap opera' effect.-Color and Blacks have been very impressive. My previous LCD LG (i think 09 model) would go to 'lit black' on dark scenes, kind of like an extremely dark grey. I would say this TV is as close to real color and contrast as you can get.-Nice sized remote, not a wii type.-This TV does have a physical power button on the bottom, that is kind of like a joystick you can navigate a mini menu. Cool feature.-Optical out, which I also use with a Soundbar/Wireless sub-woofer.-True 16:9. Fits fully on the screen, no black bars.Cons:-Wall mount issues.After having issues with this  http://fave.co/1bADEyN  popular Cheetah mount on Amazon. I ended up getting this one  http://fave.co/1bADIyz  and it went very well. The ports on this TV are basically right in the middle of the back in the TV, right where the brackets for a wall mount go across. The Xbox 360. Coax, and HDMI fit, but BARELY. They are pressed hard into their slots from the bracket of the wall mount, and take hard right angles. Terrible design for the ports, I wish they were the waterfall type.-I expected the built in speakers to be a little better, but I'm being pretty picky here. I only listened for about 10 mins before I hooked up my quality Soundbar just to test.",75.0

10287,10288,"I saw this tv  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00TRQPSXM  at my local Brandsmart and was impressed; it had perhaps the best picture among standard LED tvs. An LG rep said the LB5800 series use an IPS panel with full array LED backlighting. With help from another Amazon member, we were able to determine the 39"" uses an MVA panel, while the 32"" uses an IPS panel (see comments). On LG's claim of full array LED backlighting, I assume it's valid, perhaps without local dimming as found on the LB6300 series.I wanted a large screen gaming monitor to sit on my desk. This tv is pretty much all screen so no wasted space. Legs are sturdy, metal with plastic finish. Powered off, the screen is dark and not quite glossy but not quite matte. Colors are bright and vibrant, blacks are deep, screen is bright and uniform. I recommend getting a computer that can use these as it makes everything simple and easy to set uphttp://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B003L1ZYYMAs a monitor, the 60hz panel works because input via HDMI from seems limited to 60hz anyway, meaning I could not overclock the 60hz refresh rate using several methods. I suggest not getting hung up on advertised refresh rates though, screen is fast and blurring is minimal even during gaming. TV does have a gaming mode which turns off video processing. While I can't assign a value to input lag, I can say this tv feels more responsive than my old Samsung with no gaming mode. Desktop text is fairly sharp, but doesn't compare to an IPS 1900x1200 monitor.I find these settings optimal for monitor/gaming:backlight = 80contrast = 80brightness = 50color = 50sharpness = 10picture mode = gameenergy saving = offOn general TV functions, menus are easy to navigate, Netflix streaming tuned in at HD with no buffering. Sound is okay, it's bottom firing, with some voice clarity lost behind the screen. Sound bar recommended for best experience. 120 motion index makes movement, especially people moving across screen seem somewhat animated, looks good though.Lastly, LG uses sturdy Styrofoam packing and box material. Box is study, corners hold fast, box center doesn't yield much even with decent pressure applied. Easy assembly and menu config, up and running in under ten minutes.",53.0

This mask is more comfortable, more adjustable, more cheaper and blocks more light, than any other Eye mask I have previously used.

I feel this is much better for vocals as opposed to instruments, though I have much more experience with using it for vocals - so take this last sentence with a grain of salt. I haven't used the program that it comes with, Cakewalk Sonar, as I directly use the mic in programs such as Fruity Loops and Ableton where I have mixing plugins available - so I cannot vouch for how good the program is but I can say that it works great with the popular audio creation programs and it is VERY simple to set up - just plug it in and go to your settings of your workspace and active it.Overall, it's definitely worth it.

10470,10471,"Being that I only really purchase Sony televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple.   Sony  Sony has finally provided a Blu-Ray DVD player for dedicated Sony users. The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Sony products go. If you're unfamiliar with Sony electronics: all remotes works for all products.  That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case. I use it with this awesome TV http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00HPMCNXI  PERFORMANCE The (high definition) Blu-ray movies played on the DB-D5500 are fabulous. (Standard low definition) DVDs are much clearer than played on my old DVD player. Nothing more needs to be said.  PROS/CONS 1) The BD-D5500 has a loading tray, which encourages proper handling of the disks by the edges. (Many more expensive players are ""slot loading"") 2) The controls are touch (not buttons)---sometimes a quick tap is good enough, sometimes it is not. I greatly prefer the tactile feedback of buttons. I find it very annoying that if I tap too quickly, nothing happens; if I tap too slowly, it ""double-reads"", e.g. ""open-close"" and never opens; or ""on-off"" and never turns on. Note that ""tactile feedback"" could be supplied by a built-in clicker that you would both hear and feel---simple cheap technology. 3) Although I don't need it, I think that it is absurd that the optional wireless adapter costs as much as the player, when Sony could surely build-it-in for $5 more. 4) Sometimes the player remembers where you paused a movie, sometimes it doesn't. 5) Despite the complaint of one reviewer, it is the standard width (17""), exactly the same as my old DVD player and my receiver. 6) The controls are illuminated, and so, easy to operate even in a dark room, but the controls are identified only by symbols. Seeing in the dark is good, feeling in the dark would be even better---that is, with my old Sony DVD player, the button on the far left was on/off, the button on the far right was open/close---so I did not even have to look at the panel to know what button to push. In my opinion the Sony was more ergonomically designed.

After ""suffering"" through life with a measly 42"" 720P Plasma, http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BB1C140  I decided to up my game so to speak. As my birthday was a approaching, I needed no more justification. Of course, Amazon'a great price certainly posed no additional barriers, so I was set.  Now before you think that I spontaneously jumped into this purchase on a whim, let me set the record straight. I've been researching an LED/LCD alternative to my Plasma ""toaster"" for quite some time. In addition to energy efficiency, I was also looking for 1080P resolution, 60"" - 70"" in size(my wife wouldn't let me go bigger), reliability, and of course price.   I narrowed my search down to Samsung and Vizio and Vizio presented the best value, and Amazon offered the best price. Here were the other two I was looking at: http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00ID2HGQ8 http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00GTE0VJ6  As for the TV, the picture is great, even better after some tuning and using it is a breeze. I ran the HDMI cable to my surround sound receiver, and made a couple of adjustments and now I use one remote for all devices. About the only negative isn't with the TV at all, but with the LED/LCD platform itself. It turns out that the viewing angle of these TVs is a lot narrower than a Plasma TV, so you need to sit close to the middle to get the best picture. That doesn't mean that everyone has to crowd onto the sofa, it just gets ""cloudy"" when you are way to the side.  The sound is fine. It's not spectacular and I don't know how it could be given the thickness of the TV. I don't notice it as any worse than my previous flat panel (LCD, 8 years old). My setup is such that I watch regular TV using the built in speakers then use my 2.1 stereo setup for movies, music videos or concerts, etc. However, the built in speakers a just fine for everyday watching.  All in all, I am very happy with my purchaseand the TV. I highly recommend this TV and Amazon/. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBG0S0",67.0

In fact, we parked them inside the garage facing forward as though they were ""parked"".This one sits a little high, so the child has to climb up to get on it. But they won't mind.I would highly recommend elbow pads and a helmet. Though we've not seen our 4 wheeler turn over on us yet, but there were a couple of times going over some big bumps on the hilly areas that it looked as though it might tip. So steer your kids away from really bumpy areas and stay on mostly level ground. This is not a TRUE 4 wheeler. It is not designed for rough terrain. It is a TOY.When it first arrives at your house, it might be best not to let the little ones know it's there. It has to be partly assembled and charge overnight (you have to plug it in) before it can be used.

10528,10529,"I've been an Amateur Radio Operator for many years, and have more radios than I'll ever need. But when I see these Baofeng radios for under $50, I can't help myself. I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.Performance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.This is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.Pros:Price!!Very good audio on TX and RX.Good battery life.Good sensitivity and selectivity.Great features.Cons:As of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.Programming cable not included.Very quirky programming without the cable.Channel skip is only available using the programming software.SMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.Very slow scan speed.",54.0
10529,10530,"This is a very handy Preparedness option if you want to fill your bathtub with safe, potable drinking water (in advance, while water pressure is still available). These are widely offered all over the Internet at prices from $18 up. These are essentially just giant vinyl bags with a nozzle/cap closure. The same exact bag seems to be sold under various brand names, but it's the same product.    I like this simple concept. Here are some points to consider:    1. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Once full (even partially full), this thing will weigh a ton. Completely full, 100 gallons weighs 800 pounds.  It's not portable. You're not going to be lifting it out of the tub and carrying it anywhere. The vinyl would likely not survive 800 lbs of stress even if you had the manpower to lift it.    2. Once it's in place and full, your bathtub (and/or shower) are out of action and can't be used for anything else...like bathing, or decontaminating anything. So this works best if you have multiple bathrooms/tubs in order to spare one for water storage.    3. These are one-time-use items. Once you use it, and empty it, the vinyl bag is just too large to dry thoroughly after it's emptied. So there's that. On the other hand, 100 gallons of water (at 1 gallon per person per day) is a great resource.    4. If portability is a concern, you can achieve much the same thing using clean large plastic storage bins (Sterilite brand or similar) and stacking those in the tub. Same concept but capable of being moved if necessary.    SUMMARY: If you have a bathtub you can afford to dedicate solely to water storage in an emergency, this is a fast, easy, simple and clever solution to hold 90 days+ of survival water for one person, 45+ days for 2 people, etc. It pays to comparison shop on price. It's large, and a challenge to dry to dry out hygienically for possible re-use (consider a blow dryer and a funnel?), so I consider this a 100-gallon 'disposable'. On the whole, at around $20, this is a great solution at a low price for 100 gallons. Just make sure you have a tub you are willing to dedicate solely to water storage.    Hope this is helpful. Stay safe and happy trails, everybody.    PS: I just read reviewer Jennifer Gonzales's comments that people often overlook that they already have a ready source of clean emergency water in their home water heater. That's very true, and good to remember. There are lots of good how-to videos on YouTube on this--you'll just need to know in advance which valves are involved, and most units will need a crescent wrench to open the faucet type drain at the base of the heater.",105.0
10530,10531,"As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.The band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.The watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the ""start/stop"" timer function.  The lower button is the ""reset"" button once you've stopped the timer.One of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.This is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing.",72.0

However, it does include natural fruit sugar, as all juices do, which is part of the fruit juice - 26g sugar in a one cup serving.

He and his wife check in to the hotel and Danny carefully plays the slot machines.A man who considers himself a 'Servant of History' looks into the etiology of songs.

It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.It IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.Features I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers. Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range.

10552,10553,"I got these on a whim.  I needed a set of accurate dividers for fine woodworking projects that involved copying and transfering small measurements - at the level of a few thousandths.  The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn't want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.These calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5"", but the effective usable span is more like 7"", so they're not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado's, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn't matter much.At $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I'm familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don't do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.This might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.",45.0

Once they're set, put them where you want and get sitting!There's not much else I can say aside from the fact that they're comfy. The backs have a bit of give so you can lean back a little, and they're very light, making transporting them a breeze. Cleaning them up is equally easy, them being plastic and all. My home has hardwood floors and there haven't been any scratches from the legs when they've been moved or bumped.I got a pair in black, mainly because I felt they'd look better over time with use. Both the white and red are good colors too, and it could be fun to get one set in each color. These things deserve the high review rating.",48.0
10570,10571,"A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5"" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a ""I love my SSD"" sticker.Write performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes (""dd"" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5"" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place.The ""sweet spot"" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious).The OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage.A fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba.

10579,10580,"We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable.  Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.",60.0
10580,10581,"This car seat seems like a decent inexpensive solution for your child.    Pros:  - Small, can fit in the middle of a small sedan and still fit 2 adults at either side without much hassle.  - Easy to install... Some other car seats leave a lot to be desired.  - Will last from 5 to 40 pounds, which is about from birth till about 3 years of age. (obviously varies depending on child, this is just a rough estimate) This is for back facing carseat.  - Goes up to 65 pounds for forward facing.  - Buckles work fine. My other Graco had buckles ""voluntarily recalled"" this one has the newer styles already, so I don't foresee a recall. They are easy to adjust and to buckle  on or off.    Cons  - I have other Graco car seats, and the cushion/fabric seems like it's better quality than this. This was a small disappointment.    Overall, if you are looking for a first carseat, and got less than 150 to spend, this is a good choice.",36.0

10582,10583,"This is actually a beautiful piece, especially if you have a guy who usually prefers a sports watch but sometimes needs a dress watch for dressier occasions. This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.Better yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.I personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.The face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.That said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.",14.0

10587,10588,"When it has came down to Citizen watches, they have been both a hit and a miss in regards to their value. They have had a huge hit with making classic and distinctive watches, and have a big miss when it has came down to catering to younger horologists with timepieces. Their Drive collection has honestly lagged in terms of design and distinction as well as quality for the long-term owner of a timepiece. This timepiece from Citizen, actually does more to confuse the owner than drive in regards to the overall value of the piece. It does have a lovely leather strap and significant movement, but that is really all there is to it. What I do not like about the watch is that you see the watch in 3 directions. The second display seems much bigger on the watch, while the regular time display, and the military display seem much smaller and weaker on the watch.

10591,10592,"I received a free item to review.  The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range.",38.0

10593,10594,"Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1"", and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13"" cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts",39.0

10595,10596,"Looking over these reviews you see a wide variety of applications for this versatile weather seal.  My two uses to date:    1.)  Insulation for the door of this humidor - [[ASIN:B005KLQURG Havana Cigar Cafe Display Humidor]].  I found that sponge rubber weatherstripping compressed too much in a short period of time and was not providing the necessary seal.  This rubber weather seal worked out perfectly for this application.    2.)  Bed rail fastener gasket - this is a much less conventional use for this product but it was effective for me.  My bed has a wooden head and foot board with wooden side rails that fasten to the foot/head boards with metal hardware.  With movement on the bed the friction of the side rails against the head/foot boards resulted in a distracting squeaking sound.  I used this rubber weather seal as a gasket where these pieces meet and it eliminated the noise.  In fact, I can't believe just how well it worked for this purpose and suggest you give it a try if you encounter this same annoyance.    I purchased this in September of 2014 and paid $6.99.

10599,10600,"Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himselfFor some reason, music stores and concert programs file British composer Michael Nyman under “Classical Music”. I find this interesting because that’s not really what Nyman’s music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for “The Piano” and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a “classical composer”?Next is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his “pieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nyman’s work is fast and he “borrows” tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nyman’s work.This wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthaus’s intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nyman’s tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled “Musicologist Scorse”. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nyman’s “hits” (but not “The Piano” and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus – for those not familiar with the composer – is a 52-minute film “Michael Nyman – Composer in Progress” from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but it’s nice to have it here as a bonus.If you are a Nyman fan like me, you’ll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the “portrait” first and then the concert.The BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm“Anything Phonographic”",52.0

It just isn't going to stand up to too much.The interior divider does a great job of holding games, but isn't stitched all the way through, so there's some risk of hard objects one one side scratching the other side, if the divider shifts too much. Similarly, I definitely wouldn't want to use this for carrying around much more than a USB cable, cleaning cloth, and some games. Fitting the AC adapter and power cord in the pouch is possible, I guess, but I'd be really concerned about the plug scratching my Vita.Amazon usually has this for almost half off MSRP, which is a very nice deal.

10624,10625,"I needed a relatively short garden hose and this APEX REM 15-foot hose fit the bill at a reasonable price. This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.Ali Julia review",24.0

10631,10632,"1945 is year zero, the year in which the real battle for peace began in many ways. Ian Buruma sets out to write a history of that year; but more than that - he examines the aftermath of the war. Little known facts and incidents populate this book, even if one has been a frequent reader of this time period's history. At points a reader can be caught off guard by some of the comparisons. The celebration of VE Day is compared to Beatle mania. The structure of his writing can also be confusing in places. He writes about Germany and then in the next sentence of Japan, without a comparison or a break in the organization.Much of the study is not so much about the rebuilding after the war, but the horrors still inflicted on the people that survived and their fight to survive the peace. Even rations were cut in Britain after the armistice. The retributions of soldiers and civilians, the rejection of soldiers returning by friends and relatives are examined. We learn of graves opened in the search for valuables and gold teeth, and dead crows for sale for food. This is not really the reconstruction, but the roadblocks that came after the war.This is a hard read, to know of the killings and revenge that fill its pages. It is, in many places a tough view of human behavior; but we also see the very hard attempts to bring the shattered countries and people back to a semblance of normal life. There is an outstanding analysis of the British electorates' rejection of Churchill.Still, even with the choppiness in some of the writing and of various sentence structures; this is still a must read for those who wish to learn of the time after WWII and the attempt to make peace, despite the terrors many faced. Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list.",38.0

10635,10636,"Got this to replace the aging headband on my [[ASIN:B0006NL5SM Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms]]. It does this just fine, in good style comparable to the original.  Pros: * Look is very similar to the original (one more snap, same color) * Fit is a tiny bit tight, but it does go on OK * Length is perfect * The cushioning is nice; I don't feel the headphones' weight up there at all  Cons: * The material feels delicate, like it'll probably wear out faster than the original; time will tell * The underside material (what contacts the metal band) is not nearly as durable as the material in the original, which is quite tough. This may never become an issue, but given how the DT 770's adjustment never stays put, this could manifest in some internal tears.  Other thoughts: * For the price, a nice replacement headband. I'll update periodically as it ages to note how it has performed. So far so good.  Followup: Nine months in, and I'm upping to 5-star because it's lasting, taking normal use and minor abuse like falling prey to cat shenanigans. No rips and tears, still soft.

But when I watched the Blu-ray of the theatrical cut, instead of the 5.1 audio track that was promised on the back of the box, I could only get a 2-channel stereo track. Knowing my DVD of the movie has a 5.1 track, I figured maybe there was a problem with my Blu-ray. So I posted my issue on the Scream Factory facebook page, and they were kind enough to respond to the post:Sorry but there is not a 5.1 track on the theatrical cut on all discs. We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed.The misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience.

I cut the cubes into tiny pieces, small enough to fit down the tube of this toy. Then, I used the Pupperoni treats to plug up the small holes on the sides, and a really big piece of Pupperoni or a beef liver cube to plug up the large end of the tube.

10663,10664,"Like a lot of gamers, I was very impressed by the early footage from Epic Mickey and Warren Specter's enthusiasm for the project. However, upon playing it, I'm decidedly mixed.THE GOODThe game is visually beautiful, really pushing the Wii's graphical capabilities above and beyond. The cutscenes look incredible, like a real cartoon. The levels are absolutely brimming with visual treats - no boring fields of grass or carbon copies of the same building repeated over and over. Look closely and you'll spot some cool Mickey paraphernalia in some levels.Using old cartoon strips as settings for the 2-D levels is ingenious. It's too bad they don't go on longer and only serve as transitional levels.There is some replay value. There are a lot of pins, which might interest players who like collecting Disney pins in real life. More interesting are the unlockable cartoon reels and concept art.THE BADThe gameplay. It just isn't that exciting. It seems the game was torn between appealing to kids and holding the interests of adult gamers. Epic Mickey was billed as a platformer, but the never reaches anything as exciting as the Mario games. There's some jumping, there are some decent moments, but it's mostly just fetch quests where you have to find an item for somebody. However, the fetch quests often seem forced as they come at random times from people who aren't well developed characters (there are exceptions - I liked Horace the Detective).Other reviewers have criticized the camera system and I do agree. It's not a deal breaker, but there are times when it refuses to give you a clear view of what you need to see.THE UGLYThe game is too hard for kids, too easy for adults. I think this game would have benefitted greatly from allowing the user to adjust the difficult setting.THE FINAL WORDAt the end of the day, there's a lot of potential in Epic Mickey,but I can't really say it's a great game. It's probably one of the better third-party games for the Wii, but that's not saying a whole lot. I will probably try Epic Mickey 2 because Warren Specter seems aware of Epic Mickey's flaws, but I won't be rushing to get it on Day One.",55.0
10664,10665,"If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.",44.0

Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren’t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.",25.0

10668,10669,"I was expecting to like this book much more than I did. There was some practical stuff in the book, but not as much as I would have hoped. This book presents the husband as the authority in the house. In all areas. At all time. Kitchen needs to be remodeled? Husband decides how. Kids need new homeschool curriculum? Ask Dad what he want them to learn. It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.Overall, I don't recommend the book. Want something better and along the same lines?

10674,10675,"I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a ""sex only - no strings attached"" common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since ""Ghostbusters"" in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in ""Butterfly Effect"", ""The Guardian"", ""My boss's daughter"" and ""A lot like love"") and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of ""Notting Hill"", ""While you were sleeping"", ""When Harry meets Sally"" or ""Must love dogs"" - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of ""A lot like love"" (a lesser, albeit honest film).

It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert.

10732,10733,"I used to buy and play with only brand-new balls.  Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them.  So, now I only use second hand Callaways.  Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That's how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.The contraptions works like this:  It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of ""clicks"" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.-It's not the best device:- It's hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.--It does work OK:- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge.- It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.----The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.I do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!",65.0
10733,10734,"GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed.No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE.  The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable.  A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to ""bounce off of.""

The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy.There is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans.Where Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game.What makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate.But then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes.Because this is, after all, a video game.Still, I appreciated that early part.

10762,10763,"Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.Sometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.The world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.

Once this was done the shower head/hose supplied an excellent flow ofwater with which to shower with.  This thing worked fantastic, I love it.

10796,10797,"This is a great family game to play, as long as you don't have any sore losers in your family or gaming group. This game is half offense and half defense. As long as everyone is just out for themselves, this game is a lot of fun. If one person is ganged up on or if ""teams"" are formed, things can get a little ugly.The premise of the game is already described pretty well in the publisher's product description, so I won't go into that any further. What I will say is that the game can be taught to play in about two minutes, and anyone aged 5 or older will be able to play it without any trouble. This game has a fun theme and is very light in terms of concepts and rules, making it an easy entry-level game for anyone who isn't accustomed to ""designer"" games. Play time for the game is around 30 minutes if four people are playing, but shorter is fewer are playing. If you want to expand the game's number of players to five or six, there is an expansion available ([[ASIN:B005FPEWCC Survive 5-6 Player expansion]]) that must be purchased separately.

10800,10801,"I wasn't sure what I thought about Zero Water, but I have been a Brita and Pur user for years. I'm always interested in trying different water filtration technologies and seeing how they taste. Conclusions with this one:1.  It does produce water that tests as no particles / dissolved solids2.  It doesn't filter out some things that the other two big brands do. Certain bacteria, cryposporidium, etc. This is declared on the package insert.3.  The water it produces may feel better, but may or may not taste better.It clearly changes the water. The filter itself is about 2-3 times the size/volume of a Pur or Brita. The water feels more wet in my mouth. I like this. What I don't like is that the water it produces for me doesn't taste as good as what I get out of Pur (which is what I'm currently using). I do like the feel better, and it makes more clear ice cubes, so I am going to (gulp) use them together. First the PUR, then this one.And now for why you shouldn't buy this one unless you're one of two people.  This pitcher is poorly designed. The lid barely stays on and doesn't lip down over the edges to prevent spills when the top filler area has water in it-- for example, refilling to the line and taking it back to the fridge.  The flip lip that opens when you pour is terribly thin. The edges of the plastic were sharp and not polished. The only positive about this pitcher is that the handle is designed very sturdily. That being said, if you need an 8 cup instead of 10 because you absolutely can't fit a 10 cup, this model might be for you.The other person who might want this one is someone who doesn't care about the tester. This one has an analog result tester: Light on means bad results, light off means good results. Or the device might just not be testing at all.... I didn't like that. The model that does 10 cups, and comes with the digital tester is only $2 more!If you have enough space for the 10cup, and you'd prefer a digital tester rather than a cheap analog one, go for the 10 cup model.",62.0

(It has since been retied and enjoying the good life on a shelf).  These mugs are not the kind that will appeal to everyone for sure.  You have to have a real nostalgia thing going to enjoy it them, or just like the feel of it over an open fire on a cold morning or evening.  Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming, but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me.  The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I don't get the coffee as hot as over a campfire.As to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling, I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit' near indestructible which is not true.  Just because they are made of metal you can't toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather.  I've always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them.  No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast.

10816,10817,"My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT.  I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in.    Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth.  There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution.  You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted.    I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor.  I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub.  It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that.  Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a ""tub toy"" primarily.    It works well and delights children.  I had no issues with the operation of it.  Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order.    EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries.   I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out.   We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to ""use them later"".   I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird ""rest"" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well.   So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick.  We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to ""rest"" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money.",55.0

10827,10828,"[[VIDEOID:mo154JOVRZUKSIM]]I was impressed with the comfort and audio quality of the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones. The ear cushions are supple and comfortable, even for wearing for extended periods. I acknowledge that I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since 78-rpm phonograph records were the primary media, so I do have some idea what good audio sounds like. I ran through one of my favorite playlists, and the music sounded as good or better than with any of the headphones that I've used. Vocals had excellent clarity, and the range of sound was very good with rich trebles and deep, but not overpowering, bass. One feature that I haven't seen on any headphones that I've used is the bass level control, a rotating dial on the left headphone. To my ears, it had a small but noticeable effect on the bass level, but my preference was to leave it in the default position.Two of the songs that I use to check out headphones and speakers are Annie Lennox's ""Love Song For A Vampire"" (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' ""Wipe Out"" with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff. Both sounded great with the MX7 headphones. I also played a couple of stereo setup utilities (""Channel Balance Test"" and ""Stepped Stereo Pan Test""), and the headphones passed with flying colors.The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I wore them for a hour on two occasions while evaluating them. The adjustable headbands allowed a good fit, and the thick ear cushions were comfortable. Both headbands will extend up to 1½"", and the earcups will rotate about 15 degrees horizontally for the most comfortable fit.The headphone kit includes a 52"" cable with an inline microphone (for using with a smartphone) and 3.5mm plugs. The plug that fits into the headphones has a rotating locking mechanism that ensures that the plug can't work loose, a very helpful feature. The headphones and cable fit nicely ina zippered soft case.In my opinion, the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones are premium-quality headphones that combine exceptional audio quality and comfortable design to give a very pleasurable listening experience.",45.0

The weight displays in seconds.  Since you use two hands, I had no problem with my smaller carry-on.  I did have to corral my son-in-law to weigh the larger as I am too short to get the thing off the ground.  (I could probably pack myself in that suitcase without too much discomfort LOL.)The directions suggest that you underpack by a pound, then stash the scale in your suitcase.  I simply threw it in my pocketbook, where it took up only a minimal amount of space.  SO much easier than messing around with the bathroom scale trying to balance the suitcase!Recommended",33.0

He runs into some issues as Jan really doesn't want to be rescued at this time and there are all kinds of people looking for her and will kill anyone who gets in the way. Avery gets in deep, and stays committed as the story takes a twist.This is a crime/drama with some action. The characters didn't grab you. There was nothing special about the twist, in fact it made the film cliche and formulaic. Glen Gould plays a rather boring leading man.

Having said that, this is a book review - not a review of Scott Walker - so I've downscaled it to 4 stars based on the book itself.  The book discusses the challenges and controversy of passage of Act 10 in Wisconsin, as well as many other reforms instituted by Walker and the Republican majority in response to a budget crisis in 2010.  The book lags and repeats in spots, but is generally well written and easily read.  His principles and approach are well documented, and his positions as well as prescriptions are well articulated at a macro-level.  The book coveys the palpable tension of the 2011 protests and their aftermath.  As Walker begins to contemplate a run for President in 2016, it is important to be informed - and this book will give you some insights into the man and his methods.",24.0

10838,10839,"This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler.",35.0

10849,10850,"I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author.",48.0
10850,10851,"I bought six of these plus an EV ZXA1 powered subwoofer and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. They've been used as a monitor rig for my much larger QSC KW system and also as a mini rig for small clubs where the speakers filled both main and monitor roles. The inboard DSP works really well to smooth out the peaks and clipping and it allows for perfect Xover free matching of subs and tops. I used a pair of these tops with a pair of QSC KW 181 subwoofers and it worked in that configuration as well. They are not exceptionally loud, but they will do small rooms pretty well and have no problem working as floor monitors. Along with one of the ZXA1 powered subwoofers I was able to fit six of these and a 12 channel mixer in a tiny Toyota Corolla for a gig at VA Beach. I even brought lights and stands and it all fit in there with no problems. I surprised some veteran musicians who at first judged my mini rig as underpowered from the looks alone, when I turned up the kick drum during soundcheck to reveal that this full range system does not lack low frequency extension (in fact the sub provided the kick drum thump we all know and love!).

10857,10858,"Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster.I won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this ""biographical"" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.In the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans.

10862,10863,"I own a Linco Flora Fluorescent Light Bank. It's a wonderful light head but, if you want to use a softbox, the Linco Flora Hexogen Easy Softbox is the only one that fits it. Conversely, the Easy Softbox only fits the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank.  CONSTRUCTION: The Hexogen is a modified umbrella sans central shaft. It appears well made with heavy duty nylon fabric, reflective interior, steel ribs, plastic nylon hub and a velcro secured white diffusion panel/cloth. Compared to Neewer softboxes, it's heavy duty. Build is similar to LimoStudio softboxes, albeit twice as expensive. While the 35-inch hexagon shape makes nice catchlights, it’s bulky and can’t be rotated for a smaller profile like rectangular softboxes.  SETUP is easier than a standard softbox with component ribs but more fiddly than a umbrella softbox or Brolly box with central shaft. Begin by manually spreading the ribs open. Secure by pulling the string through the center hole until a latch locks in place in. To collapse, press the latch. It’s faster and less fiddly to simply push the hub with my palm until it locks. The pull string is its weakest element, albeit easy to replace if broken. Slow and gentle assembly is recommended and don't muscle or jerk that wee string.  Installation on the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank is fussy compared to a shoot through umbrella or umbrella softbox: align ribs with indentations on the Light Bank, compress hub until you feel a slight give and tighten front and rear thumb wheels. If you don't maintain compression during lockdown, the thumbwheel shaft will not bite into the hub. Setting up the Easy Softbox is marginally faster than a normal softbox. Maybe a minute saved? Nevertheless, it works wonderfully with the Flora Light Bank: pleasingly even and soft light with attractive catchlights. It also looks professional and clients are impressed!  MUSINGS: The Flora Light Bank and Hexogen Easy Softbox are available as a kit but are fifteen or twenty bucks cheaper whenpurchased ala carte. Oddly, neither the head or softbox ship with instructions or even a link to a PDF or video tutorial. Experienced studio shooters will figure out how to assemble and use these products in a couple minutes. After all, they’re similar to other CFL heads and umbrella softboxes. However, a beginner will have a tough time setting it up. The included storage bag is a cruel joke. An inch more in width and length would have made it much easier to fit the folded softbox. I keep the Hexogen in an old Vanguard tripod bag. Finally, unlike some other reviewers, the item I received was emblazon with the Linco Flora logo on both softbox and bag.  FINAL BURB: Improvements I'd like to see are a metal hub, stronger pull cord, larger storage bag and enclosed instructions. It’s pricy compared to my LimoStudio softboxes but the Hexogen Easy Softbox is a solid product: integrates well with the Flora Light Bank, boasts quality materials and construction and renders pleasingly soft light.",94.0

I guess if you don't have an Ikea or a similar store anywhere near by...Pros:- Color is a nice darker cherry/- Marker included (more on this later)Neutral:- Very heavy. At around 125 pounds, I was expecting it to have some solid wood pieces, mixed in with some laminate ones. However, it's all laminate, not one piece of it is made of real wood.- Putting it together was cumbersome but relatively straight forward, you have to hammer in a few pieces (per the instructions) that on other similar products you typically screw in.Cons:- Every single one of the 10 or so ""wood"" pieces was scratched. Not one of them came in perfect shape. Vendor is well aware of it, as they send you a brown market to paint over the chipped/scratched sections. The good thing I can say, is that the marker hides those defects effectively. (one of the reasons this gets 2 stars instead of just 1)- Instructions are poor. In one page they will tell you to attached something one way, in the next page the drawing will have them a different way. (the first page was right...)- Hard to align, any slight push from the side readjusts it slightly. lets say align: | |  push a bit to accommodate to a corner and it ends up: / / (obviously not that inclined, but it doesn't keep its shape very well).- Expensive. At around 200 dollars, I was expecting a slightly higher quality product. Say a grade or two above Ikea, as opposed to much lesser quality.If this was made of real wood, (or have at least the outer more visible pieces (say the doors) made of real wood, and scratches were limited, the product would have been a 4 star product.

The characters, both living and ghostly, are vivid and pull you into the story.  There were times some of the characters were doing some stupid things, but even then I usually felt sorry for them.  The plot moves forward on two levels involving the present and the past.  Both mysteries are compelling, although I usually found myself more involved in the modern mystery.  Yet the historic mystery packed a real emotional punch in the end.  There was a sub-plot I didn't like because Emma was being stupid and complicating her life.

Add to it is Anolon is chef tested and restaurant approved.To make a good thing even better, this skillet is not heavy and is very easy to work with.  It cleans easily after each use.  Your food cooks evenly and thoroughly.  Anolon is also noted for its nonstick products and I have had only positive experiences with Anolon products...",29.0

The torque on this drill is obvious when you use it the first time.  this has a dial clutch actuator, so you can choose any torque limit you wish - and the lowest torque setting is a good place to start with small screws! When the drill reaches the torque setting, the drill stops. This drill is well-designed and well-engineered.  It is ideal for tight quarters.The LED is bright and illuminates the workspace well.  When maximum torque is achieved the LED changes to red when the drill stops.  Nice feature.The advantage of the bare tool is that you don't have to buy additional batteries and chargers.  It does not come in a plastic box - which would have been a nice addition.  It uses the new M-18 batteries.Great drill.  Recommended.",32.0

It took me a little time (and extra purchase) to get the @TV connected.  Once I had it connected, I then went to download and install the app on my android phone, which I thought was free.  When I saw the fee for it, I was taken aback.  I ""know"" that before getting the @TV system, that I had read it was free.  I went back onto Amazon and reread everything.  Then I realized the tricky (in my opinion) wordplay where it says free tablet app.  No, they were not lying, but it's a slight bit shady (once again, in my opinion).  So I then paid the money for the app, on top of the extra money I needed to spend to hook up the connectors.  I've used a slingplayer in the past and understand that the system is going to occasionally have some glitches.  I had problems viewing on my phone more often than I did with the old slingplayer I had used.

10890,10891,"This product is designed for those who love to spend time in the great outdoors.  Usually you can find a fast moving stream or lake to do your laundry in.  However, many other alternatives to this bag are prone to break or fall apart after a few uses.  This bag is meant to last.  I have never been a fan of using any kind of soap or detergent when in the outdoors.  First off it is not ecologically a good idea to use regular cleaning soap in the outdoors.  You have to worry about polluting the waterways and you also have to be concerned about the smell.  Any kind of smell to soap or other things you use on your body will attract things you do not want near you!!!!  Think insects, bears, etc.........  While those creatures love the smell of city folk.............those who are backpackers or hunters know you do not want to be dinner for the mosquito.  I use a non scented, non polluting soap for washing both clothes and body.  With this little guy you can easily do both.  No need to carry special soap....all you do is take your body soap and shave off a bit with your knife....and place in the bag.  This bag is made to last.

One thing we didn't realize we needed was a small dry bag to pack different things in (towel, change of clothes, phone, camera, lunch, whatever) to bring with us, because the kayak lets in water and things get damp very easily.This bag is perfect for that- it's very roomy, but still compact enough that it fits neatly in the boat without taking much room. The orange color is a benefit, because if it does go overboard, or if you leave it on the shore, you can easily spot it from a distance.

10894,10895,"WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.",52.0

Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose.

There's also the two and half meter tall flightless bird and the Andrewsarchus.I've had this on book on my desk for a week now and it never fails to catch the attention of the numerous adults who wonder through.

The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.Channing Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.

Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.

This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!",30.0

10924,10925,"It’s been years since I watched Disney’s The Rocketeer.  (It’s been so long the copy I own is on VHS.)  My memories of the film are dim, but I remember enjoying it.  That’s why I picked up Hallmark’s High-Flying Hero, an ornament based on this character.Not one of the more popular live action films from the 1990’s, it was set in the 1930’s and featured a young man who finds a rocket pack and winds up using it to defeat Nazi’s in Hollywood during the period.  Pure escapist fun, or at least that’s what I recall.  It was based on a lesser known comic book character and definitely has that superhero feel to it.The ornament just features Cliff in his outfit at the Rocketeer.  He’s got tan pants and an orange/brown jacket on and is wearing a helmet, so you can’t really see his face.  His jet pack is on his back with flames coming out of them, and he’s semi-prone because he’s flying off to save the day.Now, even though I’m not a diehard fan of the movie, seeing and buying this ornament still made me smile.  It looks just like my memory of the character, so they did a great job with the sculpt.  And it is nice to see them doing something with a relatively unknown character.  I must not be the only one because this was a limited edition ornament, and it flew off the shelves.Since The Rocketeer is flying here, you really have to hang this ornament to display it.  Not surprising if you look at the ornament, the ring is sticking out of the jet pack.  He looks like he's tipping slightly to one side, but I guess that just means he's turning.  And he hangs at an angle that makes him look like he is rising into the air, a detail I love.It’s nice to see Hallmark taking a chance with a popular but lesser known character.  Based on how popular High-Flying Hero has been, I hope they’ll do more such characters, limited edition or regular line.",46.0

The chapters take differing looks at the linkage of inequality with democracy. Some are more qualitative, others more quantitative. There is even an effort to use quantitative techniques to analyze Athenian democracy!One of the more interesting chapters is an essay by Edward Muller, in which he statistically analyzes the relationship on inequality to democracy (chapter 5). In several tables reported in this chapter, he finds that greater inequality is associated with lower scores on a democracy index across countries.

Eventually I plan on purchasing a second PLAY:5 to use them as a stereo pair in my bedroom, or to move into separate rooms while cleaning the house.In regards to the SONOS system as a whole; I had initial misgivings before making the purchase, mainly due to price and the effective locking-in to the SONOS ecosystem. I have a variety of Apple products and I'd previously been quite happy using my AppleTV with AirPlay to stream music to my main audio system, but was looking for a portable speaker to use in the bedroom and outside on the patio.I had been very tempted by some of the B&W AirPlay speakers, but I started looking at SONOS tech for the following reasons:- AirPlay from a mobile device can only stream to a single speaker. A laptop or desktop can stream to multiple destinations, but isn't as convenient as an iPhone or iPad for music control.- AirPlay is very dependent on the quality of your home WiFi network. Any interruptions or glitches in the wireless connection will cause issues with the stream.The SONOS system sets up it's own independent WiFi network as to not be impacted by the usage of your home network. SONOS devices stream the music directly from the internet or your music library requiring only your mobile devices (Android / iOS phones and tablets) to be used for remote control.Setup is very easy, authorization of additional devices or controllers is done by a simple button press on an existing device.The core thing to be aware of is that for the SONOS devices to connect to the internet, one of them MUST have an Ethernet connection to your home network. All SONOS devices come with an Ethernet network port, and SONOS sells $50 the BRIDGE device specifically to perform this role if you don't already have another device in range of an Ethernet port.In my case I purchased a PLAY:5 and a CONNECT device. The PLAY:5 is in my bedroom and the CONNECT is hooked up to my home theater receiver via a digital optical connection. The CONNECT plays the part of the BRIDGE as it is connected directly to my home network so I didn't need to purchase a BRIDGE.I can heartily recommend the SONOS system and do so regularly to colleagues, friends, and just about anyone who'll listen.",27.0

10933,10934,"This [[ASIN:B00GHXUU18 Ivation 4x 2.5"" Silicon Ice Ball Mold Tray]] is a huge hit at Grandma's!  One of these arrived from the manufacturer one day last week and we have been having a blast with it ever since.  This well-made mold makes ice balls about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and is made of food grade silicon, heavy enough not to bend on the way to the freezer.  Yes, it ""only"" makes four ice balls at a time, but one ball will last an hour in a glass of water and more than two in soda - perfect for drinks (though you may want to pick up some glasses with wider bases).  It's really the ""fun"" stuff we've been having a ball with though.With the holidays coming and lots of entertaining to be done, we've  put a few mint leaves, a few pieces of fruit or twists of lemon, orange or lime into the bottom half of the mold before adding water for a pretty effect once frozen.  We've also filled  the balls with punch  ingredients (minus any carbonated beverage that you would add), before freezing.  The frozen punch will chill your punch without diluting it.  Frozen ice balls can be removed from the mold and stored in zippered plastic bags in the freezer.Grandma's $0.02 - Great for everyday, dynamite for entertaining.  You might want two of these!Highly recommended",28.0

Recently, I had the opportunity to use and try the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EAR HEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL.  For the retail price these headphones sell for, they are an incredible good buy. I've had some headphones that cost around $150 and the MEE ELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6-P HEADPHONES are just as good in sound quality as those.These headphones are more like earbuds since they actually go inside one's ear instead of over them. However, unlike some other earbuds I've used, these hurt my ears after extended use.  Each part of the headphone is designed for a particular ear: one piece has a small ""R"" for the right side of one's head while the other is marked with a ""L"" for the left side of one's head.  The design of the earbuds also makes them good for exercise. However, as I've only used them while briskly walking, I can't say for sure how they will do while running or doing more strenuous exercise. However, the headphones do come equipped with a small clip (like a microphone clip) that can clip on to a piece of clothing. In terms of aesthetics, I don't like the look of these headphones. It's not a terrible design, but even in the black color I just don't find them as visually pleasing as other headphones I've used and seen.While listening to music are a video with the headphones on, the sound doesn't escape the headphones unless the volume is turned up extremely high. Also, although they aren't designed as ear plugs, the headphones also work rather well at keeping most outside noises out.These headphones are also equipped with a microphone and volume control. I have not used these headphones as a microphone so I can't say how they function in that capacity.Overall, the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EARHEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL are a good set of headphones for the price.",36.0

It has some nice features like a quick tightening lever in the L-rod, and it came with some semi-nice features like the memory lock on the rail. The latter may be useful to some folks, but it also takes up some real estate on the rail itself, diminishing how far you can shift the tom position.While the construction is typical DW perfection, the design is not. It incorporates the worst aspects of a rail mount. Specifically, it slips. A simple light knurling on the rail or the inside of the clamp that grabs it would have prevented that. I have to brace the rack tom that is on my kit against my snare drum to hold it in position. To me that is a major failing.On the plus side, the hole pattern will fit the Walberg & Auge rail that was used by Ludwig, Slingerland, Leedy and others when this was the way to mount a tom. I measured it on my 1961 Slingerland lit as well as a Gretsch round badge kit. Of course it will not fit the Ludwig models that had the four-hole pattern that they used in the 1960s.Also, if you are making a purchase decision as to whether this or the [[ASIN:B0016HCG94 Gibraltar SC-GVRM Vint Rail Mount 10.5Mm L-Rod]] will best suit your needs I would personally opt for this one. I have owned and used both and this one is better constructed and sits a little lower for approximately the same price (at the time of this review).

That one is built to the old Walberg & Auge specs,  but with better tolerances and is actually less apt to slip than this DW rail or the Gibraltar model.I love my DW kit, but this rail is the weak link.",42.0

However, I think that is much of the point of these offbeat movies made for the SyFy Network.  You could easily make an argument that for investment purposes, this may be one of the best movies ever.  Made for $1 million, it's a big hit.  So here's the deal.Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former surfing champ who now owns a bar on the beach near L. A.  As a hurricane brews off the Mexican coast, strong winds move up the California shoreline.  Water spouts begin to appear at the same time as a large school of sharks.  Before you know it, the large water spouts pick up the sharks and start depositing them inland.  At the same time the tropical storm is flooding everything.  This give the re-deposited sharks access to the storm drains as well as an occasional swimming pool.Fin along with an Australian surfing buddy Baz (Jaason Simmons), George (John Heard), the local drunk and a hot employee named Nova (Cassie Scerbo) head for the hills (literally) to look in on Fin's ex-wife, April (a stone faced Tara Reid), his teenage daughter, Claudia (Aubrey Peeples) and college aged son, Matt (Chuck Hittinger).  Well Matt's away at flight school or something, April and Claudia insist they don't need help.  That is until a flying shark eats April's new boyfriend.So most of the movie has sharks appearing from everywhere eating everything and everyone in their path.  Fin and company concoct a plan to have flyboy Matt and Nova take a helicopter up into the now 3 tornados and toss in an improvised bomb which will defuse the tornado and kill the sharks contained therein.  And guess what?  It works.  One casualty is Nova when she is taken off guard and swallowed by a flying great white shark.Although for most of the movie, I thought Nova was going to be Fin's girlfriend, it turns out she's better suited for son Matt.  That way Fin can reunite with April.  But wait, Nova was swallowed by the great white.  No matter.  Fin armed with a chain saw, manages to find the same fish and dive in head first, cutting his way out from the inside and saving Nova for Matt.  I have to admit to laughing out loud for much of the film.  I was especially caught up in several lines uttered that came verbatim from ""Jaws.""

10980,10981,"REVIEW BY DOWNI:It’s always a good day in the Boyter household when an Amazon package arrives, and when this item was delivered and unpacked I did my usual: I jumped into the big box and began to purr. Imagine my surprise when Angie unrolled two big tunnels that had been in the box and left them on the floor for me to explore as well. I sniffed at the dangling toys at the entrance and crawled inside the big tunnel.  It makes a VERY satisfying rustle when I move through it, which is fun, and it has a window in the middle that lets me peek out at the people. I enjoyed exploring the tunnel and then capped off the experience by settling inside for a nice nap.The small tunnel didn’t interest me too much, but I’m a BIG cat, and kittens might enjoy it more. I might even let my sister Rikki play with it so that she’ll leave MY BIG tunnel alone.I get bored with even the best toys after a while, so Angie puts them away until they are likely to pique my interest again. The big tunnel has three hook-and-loop mechanisms to hold the tunnel shut when it is folded, which makes it easy to store, and the little tunnel can be secured shut using the loop on the dangling toy.

10987,10988,"After two excellent seasons, the question is: how much longer this show can keep up with its own success?Where season two had a build-up that went through the whole season, it took me awhile to figure out where this one was headed.  Lots of new bad guys were introduced, and dispatched.  But lots of plot threads were introduced and developed.  Eventually, one especially noticeable bad guy appeared, and didn't get dispatched, so it became clear how the season would wind up; the only remaining question was how it would unfold.The bad guy was a prominent one-season bad guy from another TV show.  He does creepy really well.  In the interest of avoiding any kind of spoiler, I won't say who it is, but those of you who saw that other show a couple years ago will recognize him immediately.I don't know if it was the complexity of all the plot threads, or whether they were presented less clearly as in previous seasons, but it wasn't always obvious why things were happening.  There are many things to note and remember to really get what's going on, but the problem is there are many other things that aren't essential to the main thread going on, too.There are hints about how it will all end sprinkled liberally through the plot.

10989,10990,"This Sony DSC W370 is light, and small enough to slide into a pocket easily. For people with big hands, you might want to attach a long strap to the camera to prevent dropping it by mistake. The menu system is pretty intuitive for settings. Nevertheless, this's a simple point-and-shoot, not much settings for me to play around. The screen is large and bright enough to see on a moderate sunny day. The small battery is the same as the one used in my Sony DSC-TX10. Be aware, the small battery won't hold too much charge (I learned it from using my Sony DSC-TX10), if you plan to use the camera for a long day, you should get a backup battery. The backup batteries are quite available in Amazon, with pretty good price.The built in flash is strong enough to improve the lighting condition for objects in 6 feet range. Time from power-off to photo taking is less than 2 second, which is good for this small camera. The delay between shot is about 1 second if no flash light is used. When flash light is used, you need to wait a little bit longer for charging the flash light, this is pretty typical for camera in this price range.The photo quality is just ok as the photo does not seem to be sharp. When shooting indoor where lighting is weak, you can see some grainy photos. The problem is less when shooting outdoor with good lighting.In video taking mode, the menu already declares that zooming noise will be captured by the camera. I usually edit my videos, so I can silent the zooming noise from the video clips. Not a big issue to me. When you move your camera around in video mode, the camera adjusts the focus continuously. This is a camera, not a camcorder. So, don't move camera too fast, this gives camera time to adjust focus continuously.The panorama mode is just for fun as the panorama photo quality is not very impressive. If you are seriously in creating panorama photos, I recommend to take still shots and create the final panorama photo with photo editing software.The 8x lens is a big selling point for such a small point-and-shoot camera. But the image stabilization does not seem to be strong enough. So, you need a very steady hand to take advantage of the 8x lens, otherwise the photo will be blurry.All in all, for price under $100, this would be a good buy. For price in the $130 range, there might be better options around.",58.0

10995,10996,"This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.",51.0

11028,11029,"I am a long time fan of Sony NEX cameras, and I have owned and used many of the Sony brand E-mount lenses available for the NEX cameras, including the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle, the SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS, and the SEL55210 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3. All those lenses have produced great pictures, especially when using RAW output corrected for distortion and chromatic aberrations through software such as Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom. When using the JPG mode the more recent NEX cameras, such as the NEX-5N and NEX-7, will, if the firmware has been updated, make a lot of those same corrections internally and automatically apply the corrections to the saved JPG images.The only draw back to the zoom lenses of course is that they are slow. Still, for low light level work, the use of a so-so slow lens with vibration stabilization will usually beat an optically  much better fast lens that does not support stabilization. So I was interested to try the Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8 for low light work. The extra lens speed allows for the use of a lower ISO, and the net gain in image qaulity is worth the cost to use of a fast lens.The lens has been great for work in low light, and the focal length has been perfect for close-ups of architectural details and art objects. If a photographer shoots in RAW, and uses Adobe Camera RAW or Lightroom to correct for lens distortions via software lens profiles, and to correct for chromatic aberration, or if the photographer shoots in JPG and uses the NEX camera's internal software corrections, then the few weak points of the lens are effectively canceled out. I have been very happy with my Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8, and plan to use it often on my next project. RECOMMENDED.",28.0

This board has many things going for it, several of which I will list:1) It is well made, and despite being MSI's budget motherboard, it compares nicely to boards in the $100+ category.2) It has four memory slots for a maximum of 32GB of RAM, not bad for a low-end board at all!3) It has USB 3.0 ports, something missing from many of its competitors, and even has headers for two more!4) It has a SATA3 port for getting the most of an OS SSD.5) It has one each of PCIEx16, PCIEx1 and PCI, meaning you won't have to upgrade an old PCI card if you don't want to.6) It is compatible with OSX with little to no modification.I was first drawn to MSI's motherboards after reading an article about hackintosh-compatible mATX motherboards. MSI boards, it seems, are just as easy to use as Gigabyte, and in my opinion are MUCH better looking. MSI has done a great job with the color scheme, which is understated without being too muted. With several power saving options, this is a great HTPC/general home use motherboard but don't let that put you off! It supports RAM up to 2400mhz and will play nicely with even the Core i7 processors!Now, I really want to take a second and mention MSI's UEFI BIOS. This thing is amazing, and if you haven'te experienced UEFI BIOS's yet, you're in for a treat. The thing looks great, has intuitive controls, and heck, you can even use your mouse! The BIOS has three settings: power saving, normal and overclocked. It has automatic overclocking (apparently going off of your components automagically) or you can overclock manually. I'm not an overclocker so I can't really comment, but I saw controls for changing clock speeds and voltages for both the CPU and the RAM, as well as various other settings which I'm sure others will find much more useful than I did!I tried to think of some drawbacks to this motherboard, but with USB 3.0 support and four slots of DDR3, the only minor complaint I have is that there is only one SATA3 port. Still, you can have your OS drive on the one avaialble, and the only reason I would want a second is for my test rig. Barr any possible issues like I had with my Z77MA (power cycle loop) I highly recommend this as a VERY attractive 1155 mATX board. I don't think you'll regret choosing this budget board!",45.0

11031,11032,"These Monster In-Ear Headphones are my first Monster product that is not a cable. Monster has taken the headphone market by storm and grabbed a huge market share. Why? Is it because they are really good or is it because they are experts on marketing their products? Don't know but it's probably both. These bright cobalt blue ear-buds have a very good sound. The treble is sweet and high without being tinny. The base is surprisingly good for ear-buds and it doesn't sound muddy. The mids fill in the middle well. The overall sound is crisp without being harsh, smooth without being muddy.The cable is 50 inches long.The packaging looks great if you are giving them as a gift.Lightweight so not to pull out of the ear easily.Three sizes of lite rubber ear cups are provided so they should fit just about anyone.Comes with a small velcro tie for keeping the cable wrapped up and a lapel clip.The ear-buds are magnetized on the back so you can stick the two ends together.For the price it would have been nice to have a case included.Well constructed with a solid feel.The jack turns at a 45 degree angle.Can be used for cell phone use with built-in mic. (I do not use this controller)The cable is flat instead of the usual round which seems to not tangle as easily.Overall these are a great sounding pair of ear-buds. Although pricier then many products out there they are way cheaper then high-esr in-the-ear phones. I think you'll be pleased with them.NOTE: IF YOU WANT THE BEST SOUND OUT OF ANY EAR-BUDS, IF YOU ARE USING A SMART PHONE OR TABLET, DOWNLOAD A GOOD EQUALIZER APP.

It is all about what you are into.A group of ""outsiders"" are hired by a circus, which is run by all deformed individuals and are called family. Lon (Christopher Adamson) is in charge, a man who has open sores oozing with pus. The outsiders come up with a plan to rob the circus by stealing the gate receipts. When it is discovered Lon has a ton of money including ""castles"" they opt for plan ""B"" where Lucy (Rebekah Kochan) the gang's girl comes onto Lon to the point he wants to marry her.The rest of the family is skeptic of Lucy, as well they should be.Without giving away any plot spoilers, I will dare to say there are bloody and graphic scenes. Outside of the midget, the deformities appear to be special effects. For example, the guy with no arms, clearly had arms under his shirt.I think if they had a metal soundtrack, this could have been an excellent grindhouse. As it was, it was just pretty disgusting.

11035,11036,"Theatre is a living art form, and when a play is filmed as a play, it usually goes flat. That is no less true of these musical numbers, performed for the Tony Awards, than it is of anything else.The majority of these selections are ho-hum.  Carol Channing, Zero Mostel, Julie Andrews, Yul Brennar, John Raitt, Gwen Verdon, Chita Rivera, Ann Miller, and Mickey Rooney are great talents, but you wouldn't necessarily notice it from these numbers.  Robert Preston does a memorable ""Trouble"" from The Music Man, but I suspect him of lip-synching; Bonnie Franklin is interesting if only because she was incredibly thin when she did the title song for Applause.  The selection from Cats, especially Betty Buckley's ""Memory,"" are very good--but I think everyone has seen them a hundred thousand times already.  But there are a few knock-outs.Patti LuPone is the ultimate Evita with two magnificent performances, ""A New Argentina"" and ""What's New Buenos Aires.""  Annie is not among my favorite musicals, but the performances remind me of why it was such a smash: Andrea McArdle, Dorothy Loundon, and Company really knock it out of the box.  Jerry Orbach is memorable in ""Lullaby of Broadway"" from 42nd Street, and there is a true rarity in Barbara Harris' magnificently comic ""Movie Star Gorgeous"" from the obscure The Apple Tree.  ""Willkommen"" from Cabaret and ""Kickin' The Clouds Away"" from My One and Only are also notable.

11036,11037,"I buy these locally, but I wanted to post here and say how good I think these are. That, and mention that you may want to look for them at your local grocer or Target (or wherever you shop). I can get these at either Target or Safeway for between ~$3.50 and $5 for a 5.5-ounce bag depending on the day, and you can check the expiration date when you buy locally. Buying directly from Amazon is a good way to go, though, as I know that they'll make it right if you get a bad batch from them.  Prices fluctuate so much on Amazon, though, that you certainly may find them cheaper here than locally.  There are multiple product pages on Amazon for these chips, so be sure to check around for the best price and bag size for your needs.  If you're like me, you might find a 1-ounce bag to not be quite enough.  :)I really like the flavor, texture, and size of the Multigrain version (and it's the only one that I've tried, although I've seen some of the others). They have a nice, healthy taste to them - not overly salty or oily, and I love the addition of the seeds. Btw, the seeds aren't obtrusive or make them more difficult to eat. Instead, they just add some nice additional taste to the corn. Although not triangular like a lot of tortilla chips, the shape is still good for dipping into salsa.I enjoy these chips either with salsa or simply plain. They taste good, and while likely still not a health food :), they sure seem healthier to me than a lot of the regular corn tortilla chips that I get.Two big thumbs up from me for the Multigrain. I highly recommend them.",43.0

It looks stylish on any woman's wrist and is appropriate for most occasions. It's rated 3ATM which means it's safe to wear in showers or washing hands, but not for swimming - much like the new Apple Watch.The reason I give it 4 stars is it does feel heavy - heavier than similarly priced watches we've bought from Amazon over the last few years. The heft is enough to make it a little less than the perfect daily wear I think most would like. Some women probably don't mind, but the manufacturer should have shaved a little weight to make the watch more comfortable.

I don't think the newer made in China boards are of the same quality, but they're certainly good enough for light gigging and more than sturdy enough for home recording.  This particular mixer has four mic preamps, four stereo line inputs, and enough sends and returns to set up a flexible PA or a good basic home recording studio. The mic preamps sound okay to my ears, noise levels are low, and the controls are quiet. Yes, it has a cheesy power supply (this can be replaced) and the outputs pop who you plug it in (what were they thinking??) but this can be dealt with in a PA or studio setting by turning on the power amp(s) or monitors *after* you turn on the board. The multiple effects consist of several reverbs and echoes and a few phaser/flanger effects useful for recording and less so for live sound. The quality is about what you'd expect from a guitar pedal, and you could probably do better with the effects in your recording software (which would have the added advantage of being reversible.)  While there are a number of annoyances,makeup in mind that with all the functionality available, this board costs less than a decent microphone, and for that reason alone it's a very good choice for a band or soloist or home recorder starting out. At the asking price, I think it's a very good value, too.",32.0

11084,11085,"As with most blemish fighting products, do expect a little dryness and maybe (if overused) some very minor peeling. And, as is customary, do try to begin using it every other day (or even every third day if your skin is already a little dry) and then increase the frequency of use incrementally. While there is a smell that might seem slightly off-putting, the results more than compensate for any initial discomfort. On the positive side, it leave skin soft and touchable.    Now, it is a little pricy. But, if less expensive products have seemed to fail, this might be a great moderately price system.    Like all similar lines, try it. Commit to it for about six-months. If you or your child does not see a noticeable difference, experiment with a different system or consult your physician.",25.0
11085,11086,"One of the problems that we have in this area are high winds that often send everything from toys to an odd assortment of covers flying.  One year I ended up with some sort of tarp that we ended up using for our barbecue because no one claimed it.  The Classic cover is going nowhere fast and has a lot of great qualities that make it worth while for anyone with a built-in barbecue to invest in.  We don’t have a built-in, but still can use the cover.What’s great about it are the two Velcro straps beneath the cover that will secure it to the barbecue.  Along the edges the material is elasticized, another factor that will keep it from flying away.  If it does, the barbecue will have to go with it because it’s that secure.  The cover itself is a thick, sturdy 100% woven polyester with a rubberized lining.  This is the type of polyester that I see in backpacks an luggage.There are even some gussets with small circles that will help keep the Classic cover in place when there are heavy gusts of wind.  We do have those and that’s when we sometimes find an odd assortment of things in our yard.  The gussets will divert those gusts, keeping them from pulling the cover up into the air.  The cover will not only protect the barbecue from the elements, but make it easier to clean.The cover is water-resistant and very well-sewn and designed.  Installation, if you want to call it that, only takes a minute and is intuitive.  This is nothing like those cheap, lightweight tarps that blow away, tear, or get holes in them quickly.  It would take a long time to get any wear on this tarp from putting it on and off.  This is definitely a sturdy, well-made tarp that will protect a barbecue.",43.0

Here are my observations:+ Features We Use; 2-Line Capable, Built-In-Answering System, Intercom Functionality, Caller-ID, all of which work well+ Range; Far exceeds my old system, covering all of our fairly large building+ Bluetooth; great for using wireless headsets (not included) and pairing with your smart phoneI like the design of the Base Station and have had no difficulty navigating the menu options when needed. The handsets are well made and allow for speaker phone use or connecting a wired headset.

11102,11103,"This buoyant wrist strap from FRiEQ works perfectly to bring your dropped item to the surface of the water, if that is what you seek. The strap is lightweight and comfortable to wear, while being very positively buoyant. If you seek such a strap, I would recommend this one.    We recently received a video camera from SJCam that has a waterproof shell, and have been playing with it in our fish tank and out in the snow (which we have had plenty of these last few weeks). With its waterproof case on, the camera weighs a few ounces so I hooked up this strap to it for our testing... and it went right on up to the top of the tank when let go.    Not too much more to say -- affordable, effective, comfortable and nice looking straps.    As far as hooking this up directly to the camera case (either at a strap port or via a hinge)... it is very easy: make sure that you look closely at the plastic connector on the loop, as this connector allows you to disconnect the loop from the strap. Disconnect it, loop the loop through port or hinge on your camera or device, and then connect the straps back to the loop. Very easy. It seems like some may have missed this, and tried instead to push the straps through the loop...    Neither the Amazon sales page or the retail packaging provides information on a warranty, so if an issue occurs I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive these straps gratis from the seller and put them to use in our fish tank to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.    If you are looking for a high quality pair of highly visible floating wrists straps of this construction, size, style and price, for use as I have noted above, them we would recommend giving these wrist straps from FRiEQ a try based and our experience with them.

Unlike many of games geared toward children, Ravensburger's ""Race To The Roof"" does not cause adults to cringe when a child presents it for playing.""Race To The Roof"" can be played with and enjoyed by children who are younger than the suggested age range of 5 years or older.  The objects to be located are ones with which most children will be familiar; if not, the unfamiliar items provide a learning opportunity.  Counting the spaces one must move reinforces the ability to sequence numbers.  Having to move backward gives children the opportunity to ""overcome"" a set-back and to learn that luck sometimes plays a part in who wins and who loses.The quality of Ravensburger's ""Race To The Roof"" is a bit less than I would have expected.  Instead of a game board that is one-piece and hinged in the center, ""Race To The Roof"" has a two piece game-board.  Unlike older board-game playing surfaces, this item is not constructed of a very heavy cardboard. While it might be somewhat difficult for very young children to damage, determined three-year olds would have no trouble bending the pieces.  The wooden game pieces are unevenly painted; our yellow picec shows the wood-grain around its center point.  Illustrations are simplistic; this seems to be a trend with illustrations in books as well as in games.Ravensburger produces games that are both fun to play and provide learning opportunities for children.

But, it is very bulky and doesn't have a case or anything (which would make a bulkier tool easier to manage, I think).  I used the flathead screwdriver to help my son with a wooden frog punch out.  The screwdrivers aren't too sharp, but are of good size.  For the kid who's 8 or 9 who you just aren't quite ready to get a pocket knife for, I can imagine letting them handle this tool.  I'm going to let my 7 yo son use it.  It's going to stay in our utility drawer in the kitchen.  It's perfect for that.  I won't have to go all the way downstairs for several tools and it will be compact enough to not mind storing.  We also have an interchangeable screwdriver that we use all the time, so I'm certain this tool will be just as handy.",37.0
11138,11139,"Maybe it’s just that I’ve had a lot of Mead and Mead Five Star products to review for Vine, but I’ve started ruminating on what makes the difference, quality-wise, that gets some school and office products the “Five Star” appellation and not others.  This “plain Jane” zippered binder looks to be of very similar quality to the un-killable Five Star one I have carried around for various purposes, so if there’s an “economy” angle, it’s not really that evident. And, like all zippered binders, it’s a bit pricey.This product’s angle is the lack of multiple specialized pockets and features that’s so common across the line.  One exterior Velcro-flapped pocket, and it’s not as big as it looks to be at first glance:  it will hold 2 pens or pencils and a few 3X5 index cards, and that’s it.  There are two nice full page sized interior pockets, though, so this will work nicely for a student with basic needs.  (Or maybe a fancy 3 ring pencil case for all the “tools”.)Your student may appreciate the briefcase style handle.  My kids at least are not fond of the shoulder straps on some of these all-in-ones.5 Star or regular, I have yet to see my kids destroy a Mead binder over the course of a year.  Tear and fray it a bit from overstuffing, yes.  But these things hold up pretty well even when they start to look like a strong gust of wind might tear them apart.  So I keep picking Mead over the no-name brands, at least where it really matters.",30.0

The cloth is fantastic because it's extra large and plush.  Usually, cleaning cloths are much smaller, making it easy to accidentally get a finger onto what I'm trying to clean fingerprints off of.  And the solution itself wipes away fast and easy, with no streaks. And the fingerprint resistant properties really seem to work; minimizing smudges and prints so I have to clean my glasses less.

11156,11157,"Agatha Christie's best known detectives are Poirot and Miss Marple but far from their only ones. The 1983-84 series, Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime followed the adventures of a lesser known detective pair Tommy and Tuppence (played by James Warwick and Francesca Annis).Before the series began, an adaptation of the first Tommy and Tuppence novel The Secret Adversary aired as a telefilm and told of the first adventure of Tommy and Tuppence when they met after World War I in need of work and began their careers with an ad in the newspapers and found themselves involved case of international intrigue. The plot was superb with a lot of tricks and an amazing number of red herrings. The cinematography was great for the 1980s with a far better quality than the typical British TV show of the era.The cinematography of the main series was more typical of the era which was a definite downgrade. The series finds a married Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency and assuming the pseudonym of the jailed original owner of the Agency, Mr. Blunt while Tuppence pretends to be his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson.  The stories are set in the 1920s  and the producers do a great job creating a period feel, even on a limited budget. Annis carries the show in that regard, looking very much the fashionable 1920s woman in looks as well as her general manner.The book upon which the series was based,  was a bit of a tongue in cheek look at popular detective fiction and that feel comes through with several tips of the cap to the great detectives while maintaining a light feel to most stories.  The pacing could be a bit slow with too much melodrama and lead to a resolution that was more than a little bit rushed.  There were some great episodes in the series, but some stinkers as well.  The best episodes in the series are arguably the last two, ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" (from a comedy standpoint) and ""The Cracker"" from adramatic standpoint with ""The House of Lurking Death"" probably the weakest.In the end, the series is worth watching because of the delightful performance of Annis and her chemistry with Warwick. While not a great show, like many other programs of bygone days, it will beat most of what's on television these days.",41.0

I had to run five full pots of White Vinegar and water to get rid of it.    2. One cups are horribly messy and tons of grounds make it into your coffee.  3.

Both ways worked, but shaking it up in a bag definitely gave it a more even coverage over the popcorn.

I have a BACKUPS-XS1500 LCD uninteruptable power supply and recently needed to replace the batteries.  I didn't realize until I pulled out the APC batteries and realized there was a brand name below the white APC label that APC had slapped over the sides of the batteries, in essence putting their name on someone else's battery products.  Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.  In my case, I have a dual battery, meaning I have to buy two individual 12 Volt batteries and put them together into my UPS.So it is not necessary to pay a premium for a APC labeled battery, just go with a reasonably priced option that has a name brand and good reviews and you will be fine.",26.0

This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat.

11178,11179,"My cat, (and the ones around the neighborhood that come around for hand outs), have always like Temptations.  This has been a favorite snack of all the cats I have had around here for just about as long as they have been making them. It's always been just a snack for them, given out as a few here and there.  And I have always liked the large variety of flavors.  Although these tumblers are made of pretty much the same ingredients as the regular Temptations, I don't like them as much, and neither I believe do the cats.  Although the idea behind these are for cats to play with their food, I don't think most get it or care, and they would just rather eat them.  Also, like a lot of other reviewers here have pointed out, these really are small balls, maybe twice the size of a BB...I don't think the cats recognize them really as balls to play with, or just don't bother too...Out of the three cats I tested them on, two ate them without playing, and one eyeballed them for a while but eventually ate them.  Perhaps finding the small balls rather unusual...    In conclusion, even if these were actually fun for your cat, I don't personally like the ball shape.  I think all three of the cats I feed prefer the Temptations in their traditional shapes that are much easier for them to chew.  The balls are made pretty small for the cats to find chewable, but its my opinion that most still don't like it...I rate these Temptations 4 stars for taste, with the one star off for the balls that I don't think are that good an idea... : )",28.0

11184,11185,".4.5 Stars out of 5I am amazed at the sophistication of this stroller.  It is NOT the same animal as the under $100 varieties and in ten years it will still be a beautiful, fully loaded, functional work of art.  If your budget can absorb the sticker shock associated with this stroller, you'll be hard pressed to find something more versatile or better constructed.  I'm going to start with what I think of as the negatives aspects as there fewer of them than positives.Cons:*  Price - of course.*  The Pois Black stroller is hard to see in the dark.  You'll trip over it at night and it makes me nervous to walk the neighborhood at dawn and dusk.*  There may be too many features.  It easily becomes overwhelming to try to understand how to use them all.Pros:*  High quality construction with premium materials.*  Extremely versatile and will continue to offer functionality and beneficial features as your baby grows.*  Fairly lightweight and easy to stow into the back of the car.*  You can get the baby seat from the same manufacturer and it will snap securely onto the frame.  Here's Amazon's listing:  [[ASIN:B004DIOY8Y Peg-Perego Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Myrto]]*  Front or rear facing functionality with a peek portal.*  Plenty of onboard storage.*  Water bottle holder.*  Adjustable handle to easily accommodate taller as well as shorter people.*  Turns on a dime - great for elevators and shopping aisles.*  The rear wheels lock to help keep the stroller from creeping away from you.*  Easy to clean materials.*  Beautifully designed and attractive.There are so many other features and positive things I could say about this stroller, but I think I've gotten my point across.  I did not choose the color I received and as my only real negative, I would caution parents to select one that has bright visible colors on it.  We have tripped over this stroller in the darkness of the house (insert not-baby-friendly expletives here for stubbed toes).  I also don't feel it is visible enough for strolling the neighborhood in lower light conditions.  Add a glow-in-the-dark doo-dad here and there and you've just solved this problem.I have to admit that I still don't know how to quickly use every feature of this stroller.

I have a large indoor putting green and just walking to the other end to gather balls is just too slow and tends to lengthen her training time.  So we decided to try this.PROS:1.  Portable - This is very small and can be moved around as long as you have an outlet.2.  Ball return - You can adjust the ball return speed.  So if you are practicing short putts adjust the speed slower so that the ball does not come back at you too fast.CONS:1.  Moves - This does not have the weight and does not stay in place very well.

11199,11200,"I sure do miss the glory days of hi-fi, when high quality stereo receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, and true speaker systems ruled the day!  Now everything is miniaturized and portable, with sound quality often suffering bigtime.  Sure MP3 files, iPODs, iPADs, and PC's (with their small speakers) are convenient ways to get (download) and carry music around with you, but you're missing out on palpable bass, a natural soundstage, and musical detail when you listen to most pairs of compromised headphones or PC speakers, sadly typical of most music listening done today.  Do yourselves a big favor-  if you truly love music and you wish to listen to music in all it's grandness and glory, get a good integrated amplifier (or separates- preamp and amp combo), and a great set of speakers to hook up your digital files player or PC to.  Your ears will thank you!  Contrary to belief, you really don't have to spend a fortune if you know what to look for.  Knowledge is power, and equates to savings too.  The great thing about this integrated amp is that it already has an excellent built-in Wolfson DAC, and Onkyo is a respected name in audio going back decades.  I just helped my neighbor (college student) select his very first stereo system with conventional speakers, and I suggested this integrated amp.  He also wanted a pair of good bookshelf speakers, and he ended up with JBL ES30's.  His budget was $700, which was met (including RCA to mini-plug stereo cable and a short run of thick speaker wire).  We were both floored when we listened to some of his higher-res digital files through the Onkyo and JBL's!  He said, and I quote:  ""I can now hear nuances i've never heard before, and I can now feel my music!  I never knew my iPOD could sound so great!""  'Nuff said!",48.0

11222,11223,"Let me start my saying that my needs for a Sweeper as a traditional home owner, are simply and realistic.  This unit has just the right amount of power to blow debris, leafs and even mulch. After mowing my lawn, I take this puppy out and have no problem sweeping clippings and other debris off my driveway and various areas around my front and back yards. Wet leaves are a bit tougher and may require you getting really close with the sweeper; if the leaves are wet and stuck to the ground, then you may have to shake them off with your foot first and then sweep them with G-Max.    This tool works uses very little power from the battery, even at full blast;I have the battery powered mower which uses the same battery and even after mowing both my yards, I'm able to use the sweeper on high power without the battery dying on me.    It is light, but depending on which battery is used with it, you will feel a difference in weight, but nothing that will cause fatigue.    It has a power switch and dial. The power switch starts the sweeper and the dial controls the different speeds/power.  The main nozzle is removable and it also comes with a removable tip, which has a low and high settings, which directs the air at a different angle for a  higher/lower air flow.    Again, as a home owner, I'm pleased with my purchase. If you are looking for something basic with enough power for  house chores, then look no further, this is it. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy duty sweeper/blower, then go for the gas models, they have a lot of kick for heavier work loads.",33.0

They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.The 6-year-old is a tall 49"" but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up.

11242,11243,"In anticipation of the new film version of ""Into the Woods"" I decided to take a look at this Tony winning stage production which used the original cast.  It was actually filmed for a television episode of American Playhouse that aired on March 15, 1991.  It is available on DVD and Blu ray.The story by James Lapine, who also directs, blends together various fairy tale characters (Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack and others) into one story.  The nexus is the Baker (Chip Zien) and his Wife (Joanna Gleason) and their inability to conceive a child.  The local Witch (Bernadette Peters) agrees to reverse the Wife's ""condition"" but the couple must bring her 4 items.  A red Cloak, a gold shoe, a white cow and ""yellow as corn"" hair are her demands.  Somehow these items together would release the curse of the Witch's grotesque features.Working with one basic stage, the production is pretty rudimentary but is buoyed by the music of the great Stephen Sondheim.  Peters is of course a terrific singer and gets many of the big number including the tearful ""Children Will Listen.""  I was also taken with Ms. Gleason's humorous take the Baker's wife.  She also has a fine singing voice.  I'm most familiar with her as a supporting actor in numerous films.The rest of the actors are very good and have seasoned singing voices.  The costumes were pretty original.  I was a bit surprised to see the Wolf's (Robert Westenberg) costume to be anatomically correct below the belt.  This must be a little concerning for some, especially in the first scene where he confronts Little Red Riding Hood (Danielle Ferland).The DVD is problematic.  The video is washed out and not very pretty to look at.  The editing and direction are pretty good however.  Audio is only available in stereo but it is fine.

My husband waved the open bottle under my nose and asked me what I thought it smelled like and it definitely smelled like turpentine.  The active ingredient listed is: Thuja occidentalis.  According to Wikipedia it is this:  Thuja occidentalis is an evergreen coniferous tree, in the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to the northeast of the United States and the southeast of Canada, but widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.There's a lot more said about it, but it's a tree.

11274,11275,"I was looking at bean bags and almost bought a cheaper one but I am glad I spent a little more time looking at the less positive reviews on the bag I almost bought. They complained of cheapness and odor (like chemical odors). I certainly didn't want something from China off-gassing in my house. Once of the reviews recommended a Cozy Sack instead, so I looked those up and found this item.I ordered a 4' navy bag and it arrived today. I thought the packaging was a bit small and that it might not be big enough, but after taking it out and letting the foam absorb some air, it might even be too big for my originally desired use. It was a bit of a struggle to get it out of the tight packaging without using a knife or blade, but I managed.And fortunately it doesn't stink of chemicals (unless you put your nose right up to it and take a big whiff)! If it did my wife would have had me remove it right away (she is very sensitive to that).My 6 year old son immediately started jumping on it from a couch and had a blast. He then settled down on it and played some games on an iPad, so there's no doubt he likes it.I'm happy I spent a little more for what is most likely a significantly better quality bag that has a removable & washable cover. I'm also happy that I am supporting jobs in the USA, which I don't mind at all doing when they offer a higher quality product that is worth the additional cost over cheaper & lower quality Chinese made products.Unfortunately the 4' was too big for us but the customer service was excellent and helped us convert it into 2x 2' bag chairs by exchanging the cover & bags. I transferred the foam 'stuffing' from the 4' to the 2x 2' bags.By the way, currently the photo for the 2' navy bag with the child sitting on it shows a lighter blue color. The actual color is a darker navy blue as you might expect.Here's some size info:The 2' size has a diameter of 34"" and is 20"" highThe 3' size has a diameter of 44"" and is 24"" high.The 4' size has a diameter of 48"" and is 27"" high.The 5' size has a diameter of 48"" and is 40"" high.So 5 stars from me... should anything change then I'll definitely update this review.",33.0

This protector easily fit the bill. I looked at several squid-style protectors, but they usually didn't have enough outlets. Not only does this have eight rotating outlets, it has four more stationary outlets in the center for an incredible twelve outlets.The unit was also simple to mount to the wall. I just used a few screws that I had sitting around and some drywall anchors and had the plug mounted on the wall in minutes. I am not any sort of do-it-yourself expert.Finally, one of the really great—but perhaps less-noticed—features of this strip is its cord organizer. The clip on the bottom is an easy way to tuck away all of your cords and send them off in the same direction. Not only does that make it easier to, for example, use some other cord system on the bundle of plugs (like a tube or zip ties), it helps keep the cords neat even if you don't use any other cord-management tools.This is particularly useful if, for example, you're using this strip for an aquarium or other water-related project, because the clip helps you make a drip loop without having to add more holes to the wall, etc.In sum, this is a great power strip.

There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright.    I can't open it one-handed though.

Unlike when the adapter streams music to a speaker, I could move files from my phone to my laptop via bluetooth.For the record I installed this on an ancient ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP, SP3. No problems and no issues. The laptop immediately recognized it as a new piece of hardware as soon as I plugged it in.One final feature I love is I have this plugged into a port that is closely adjacent to a second USB port and there was sufficient clearance with both ports occupied.",36.0
11307,11308,I purchased this because it says it get rid of grease and oil. I put it to the test. My power chair broke a seal on the gear box and leaked 90 weight gear oil all over the carpet before i realized it. I followed the instructions to the letter. I let it set 30 seconds and then blotted it with a white towel. It removed nothing. I tried it several times and it didn't even faze the grease. I then used my carpet cleaner with solution and it barely did anything either. I then commence to use diesel fuel on the stain with a clean rag and it removed the entire stain. there were 10 gobs of grease and now they are all gone using diesel fuel without any harm to the carpet. This product is junk in my opinion and i won't ever buy again. What a waste of good money!update: I used my carpet cleaner again after using the diesel fuel and you can't tell the carpet was ever stained.,30.0

Taking this into consideration it gives us a different view and interpretation of what he meant by his words, actions, and teachings. The book actually has me interested in studying more about who this Jesus was.A fascinating and refreshing look at Jesus.",15.0

11319,11320,I honestly think a jug of maple syrup THIS humongous is unnecessary!  While it should be noted that Aunt Jemima doesn't really have the best waffles on the market (for some reason they're really chewy and tougher compared to the superior cheaper store brand ones- go figure!) an even bigger issue is that 64 ounces of maple syrup isn't even necessary for someone like me who lives alone.  It would take a really long time (and lots of waffle eating!) to get through this whole container of maple syrup.  Then again this stuff *does* tend to last a really long time in the cabinet doesn't it?  Many months!  That's pretty dependable.    However clearly 64 ounces of maple syrup is more appropriate for a family of 4 or more who eats pancakes and waffles regularly every morning.  Only appropriate for those families and not for people like me!  I'll just settle with the smaller jugs.  It's not like I use a lot of syrup anyway.  I never understood the fascination dumping as much syrup as you possibly can on your breakfast food.  Well then again I DID have this obsession as a kid in the 80's and used to dump more syrup than I should've on my pancakes and waffles until a few years ago when dentist appointments became routine.

11320,11321,"The Raspberry Pi is basically a small computer that will just about fit into an Altoids tin.  It's powered by a cell phone charger and uses a SD card for its hard drive.  It has USB so you can plug in more storage, a keyboard, wifi dongle or more.  It has HDMI out, which will carry both audio and video as well as a normal audio headphone jack.  It has an Ethernet port so you can get it on the Internet and connected to your home network.  At the price point, it just can't be beat!I have one of my Raspberry Pi machines set up as a music server.  With a free iPhone app I can remotely connect to my Pi and stream music to my phone or to any Internet connected machine.  It is the gold standard for me, as I've always wanted a way to access all of my music on the go and this device pulls it off nicely.  It has enough power to read a FLAC file and convert it to a nice streamable MP3 on the fly, something that really impressed me.The Pi can also act as a very basic machine for those who just want something to surf the Internet.  It can be set up to stream videos over your network, but 720P seems to be the max here as 1080P video takes just a bit too much processing power.  While I haven't used it for this purpose yet, the Pi seems to be the new CPU of choice for people building retro arcade cabinets as the Pi seems to do a great job handing arcade game ROMs.The bottom line is the Raspberry Pi is a fun toy to play with and a valuable learning tool if you want to get under the hood and more involved with things like the Linux operating system.  It's low power enough to run it all the time and use it as a server and it's powerful enough to play Hi-Def 720P videos.  Buy one, you'll find a good use for it!",41.0

11330,11331,"So I have to say - historically I've stayed away from Haggar, as I always had this image of a rather staid, mass market company churning out barely-acceptable quality stuff.  But with the last two shirts I've tried from Haggar, I'm ready to eat crow.    This shirt has features that you don't typically find on shirts at this price point.  For example, you have gussets.  Gussets are small triangular pieces of cloth that sit at the intersection of the bottom hem and the side seam.  They are intended to strengthen this stress point, but you don't usually find them in mass market shirts because they are a pain to put in.  But Haggar has done so.    You have interlining in the collar.  Interlining is a separate strip of material sewn within the collar that gives it extra shape, crispness, and durability.  Again, it's kind of a pain to do it, but Haggar features it in this shirt.    Adding style is a horizontal bottom buttonhole in a contrasting thread.  Again, a nifty little detail that lots of shirtmakers don't bother with.    So this shirt is advertised as fitted, but I have to echo other reviewers in saying it's mostly fitted in name only.  There's a bit of taper but it's really not all that aggressive.  If you have a bit of a bay window you're still going to be fine in this shirt.  I did notice that the sleeve length is pretty much on target, so that tells me the cut of the armhole is slightly different between this fitted shirt and the Haggar regular fit cut.  A raised armhole, as in the regular fit, helps keep the shirt from being too restrictive but it tends to shorten the effective length of the sleeve.  In this case, a fitted cut wants to hug the body a bit more, so the armhole is lower.  I have both cuts and don't have much of an issue with either in the Haggar shirts.  This is probably the biggest clue that even though the shirts offer specialized features like gussets and interlining, the overall cuts still tend to the mass market.    The material is somewhatthin, so call this a summerish weight.  It's a nice material though and doesn't look like it will wrinkle too easily.  Overall I'm quite pleased with this shirt.",65.0

I am on Verizon Fios 50/50 and my streaming quality was very good.  Movies loaded fast on Amazon and Netflix.  The Sony uses the Opera TV store, so even though there are lot of apps available, they are all sort of like misfit apps.  All the good ones are printed on the box.  The main ones are all there.  You get WWE Network, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon., Flixster, Vudu, Youtube, Etc.  There is NO HBO GO or FIOS Mobile TV app.There was a quick update, and initialization.  It took about 10 minutes to set everything up.The Sony is also unique in that it can stream Playstation 3 games via the Playstation Now app.  A subscription is required, and costs about $20 a month for unlimited play on a growing list of 100 games.  You can also rent games daily, but you are better off with the monthly.  They have a lot of good games, such as The Last of Us, Lego Batman, Street Fighter, and more.Games loaded fairly quickly.  Every time you load a game, it does an internet connection to make sure you can stream it.  Once it streams, and you are up and running it feels just like playing on the PS3/PS4.  I could not tell a difference playing on this Blu-ray player with the PS Now app compared to the PS4 in terms of graphic quality.  They both looked similar.  Your PS Now subscription will work with your PS3, PS4, and PS TV also, but you can only stream games on one device at a time.The Dual Shock 4 controller works with this.  However, it MUST be connected via USB in order to work.  There is no Bluetooth compatibility built into the player.  You can also use the Dualshock to control the functions of the player too.The Sony also has miracast capabilities.  I was able to use my Android phone and mirror every time I saw on my screen.  This is awesome because the Opera TV store does NOT have Verizon Fios Mobile TV.  With the miracast function, I can mirror the Fios Mobile on my phone to the Sony.  This allows me to use the Sony as an extra cable TV box.The Sony is small and boxy.  It looks like a miniature PlayStation.  It has the same finish and color.Oh, it also plays Blu-rays.

But why trash a perfectly good timepiece that had proven itself to be so reliable since I had purchased it new here back in 2008? As they say, ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.""      Started searching for a decent 20mm sports watchband that was reasonably priced and not designed to look [[ASIN:B005BKPS9C too weird]] on my watch, as are some of them. Maybe I'm too conservative, but there were [[ASIN:B002Z367CK some]] that just weren't my style. Contemplated a stainless steel link band, such as this [[ASIN:B001EYVBAY Hadley-Roma Men's 20-mm Stainless Steel Watch Bracelet]], but had to rule it out as I didn't know how it would look on my old favorite watch.      By chance I found this [[ASIN:B003U98VHC AllStrap 20Mm Black Sport Leather-Contrast Stitch Watchband]] and it seemed to be a decent choice, though it was called a long length band in the specs, and I have an average wrist. Still, it's better to have one a bit long than too short, and considering that the price was reasonable, ordered it here. When it arrived a couple of days later (and thanks, Amazon Prime), took it out of the package and looked it over. It did indeed have a 20mm band width, came with a pair of replacement stainless steel spring bars, and easy to see that it was black leather... but it appeared to be a slightly different product from the one here in the photos. The end wasn't pointed as is shown in Voguestrap's product photos, but more of a squared end sport strap similar to that on the [[ASIN:B001F0PTPK Hadley-Roma Men's MSM881XA-200 20-mm Black Oil-Tan Leather Watch Strap]], if their image is correct.

11352,11353,"I'm writting the review mostly because I saw several reviews talking about the size of this thing and hopefully I can help someone (when I first bought it the dimensions were not specified, I see now that the vendor has clarified it).  This one has a 1 1/2"" diameter, that is the thread diameter (the size of the hole on your DE filter, the one you take off to let the water inside the filter completely drain out and so you can wash any sand deposits at the bottom of your filter).  The size of the cap is just over 2"", but that shouldn't matter to you, what you need to make sure is that the size of the hole is the same size as the thread on this thing.Mine is actually 2"" size, so this cap is actually too small.  On the positive side though, the o-ring is very flexible so I couldn't use the cap, but I could still use the o-ring (though I would recomend you get the right 2"" o-ring because by stretching it that much I would guess it will last a lot less than the right O-ring).  I've tried with a lot of teflon tape and you really do need the o-ring to stop all leaks.",14.0

However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.I've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.I'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.In regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.Edit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all.",41.0
11382,11383,"Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I'm older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.I don't have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUK Edge Shave Gel, Extra Protection, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] and my [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]], some days [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]] takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]], maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It's just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I've used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn't particularly strong and doesn't linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with [[ASIN:B00A0J09GG Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, 3.3 Ounce]]and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I'm going to be out in the sun or on days when I don't shave (which are usually the same day).I really like this Dove post shave product.

The instructions are very easy to follow. I have tested out all the features and some work great while others are a mixed bag. -Time/date. Very straight forward and the orange glow through the wood is great. The snooze button dims the display which is normally the setting I have it on. Note: the dot in the upper left corner of the time display means pm. -Temperature. I find this to be pretty accurate but it does depend where the back of the block is facing, for example if it's facing a window it will likely not be an accurate reading of the room temperature. The directions say it can be up to two degrees off. -Alarms. These work consistently fine and are fairly easy to set. -Speaker. The bluetooth is automatically on when plugged in and will show up when searching for devices on your portable device. To shut the bluetooth off you hold the call/pause button down for 3 seconds. Sound quality wasn't the best I've ever heard but it was decently loud and much better than expected. If you are looking primarily for a bluetooth speaker I would look elsewhere though. There is also an aux in for devices that don't have bluetooth. -Wireless charger. Even without a case on this won't charge my phone and appears to be faulty. Do not buy for the wireless charging aspect. For me this isn't a deal breaker as there is a usb plug in for charging and I have found most of these wireless chargers to be slow and unreliable. -Usb plug in. You can plug in your charging cable to this and it charges fine and eliminates the need to plug in a wall charger. This makes up for the wireless charger in my opinion.  Build quality seems good and sturdy and the product has a good weight. One thing to note is that the product is a bit larger and wider than I expected and does take up my whole night table. The product measure about 9""x 5.5""x 2.5"". Overall super unique and I recommend it even if all the features aren't up to par.

The connector works, but doesn't snap tight. A little tape would fix the problem - and to be fair, they don't really claim to be compatible.Also, take all of the Specs on the light and the battery with a grain of salt: If these are Cree Xm-l lamps, they are rated at a max  of 1000 lumens per bulb  (for a total potential of 3000 lumens -- not 3800) consuming 10 watts per bulb. Also, despite the claim of 6400 mAh battery pack, a typical 18650 Li-on cell is 2300-2600 mAh -- so 4 cells (2 groups of 2 in series to produce 8.4 volts) would give you closer to 4600-5200 mAh. At that rate a 30 watt load / an ave voltage of (2*3.5v) would give a current draw of 4.29 amps (4290 ma) so the supplied battery pack should last about an hour with the light on ""high"".It's a great light at a great price, I docked it one star because of the bogus specs -- but don't let that deter you.",23.0

A couple of months ago I did get  a new one for my wife, and after playing with hers for a little while I decided I needed one of my own.I'm really, really glad I got this model. I like it enough that I'm going to purchase another as a gift for family. With the holidays fast approaching, it would be a good addition for application use. My mother wants something that streams for shopping and watching videos and for applications like the bible online, and she also wants games. This handles all those well, plus it is easy to  use even if a person isn't so computer savvy.  The device is durable, lightweight, and you can see it well on bright days.I always hated not being able to do that - what's the point otherwise? It loads fast, processes well, and has all the user-friendly features I would want. You can easily access the menus, change settings, place applications or widgets where you want. The picture quality is great, coming in  above my expectations, and the sound is nice. Accessing files from the SD card is easy, with everything loading fairly quickly. When you look at the price, it well surpasses others in the range too.And battery life - that's been good.Battery life has always been a sticking point with others, because they die so easily. This one, with features you can tinker with to save more energy, lasts a good deal longer than I expected. If I play games it burns it faster, but when I'm reading in the day or travelling and wanting to use it, it holds up well. The device charges decently fast too, which is pretty nice.One thing I really wanted for myself was something that could easily read .cbr files (comic books) and .pdf files so I could carry them on the go.

11393,11394,"If the classic game of Monopoly seemed to take too long, then you will appreciate this newer, shorter version. Instead of B&O Railroad, it is updated with businesses and brands like Spotify, ebay, Intel, Xbox, McDonalds and Coke. Instead of zipping around the board with an iron or a dog, you have a choice of a gold token like a coke bottle, game control, French fries, and motorcycle among others.You choose your token, roll the dice and start buying brands, add brands to your tower, and buy and trade and take over brands with empire cards.  First to the top of the tower wins. The game board reminds me of Times Square in appearance a bit.Contents include: 4 towers for up to four players, 6 tokens, 30 billboard tiles, 6 office tiles, 14 chance cards, 14 empire cards, money pack, 2 dice and the game guide.  I like this shorter, express version.  I used to call the classic version Monotony, partially because my brother always beat me at it because I virtuously would save all of my $$$ and he would spend his buying up all of the real estate in the first half of the game.  In the second half, I would just go around the board and pay him rent for hours on end until I ran out of $$$.  Not a good strategy on my part.I think this new version will be a hit for families who want a quick, fun game for family game night.  It has current, relevant brands which is fun.  And not all of the brands are about material consumption: there's ebay which is great for selling and recycling, and spotify which is about listening to good music for free - although they may charge a nominal price down the road.While it involves luck more than strategy, some of my favorite games as a child involved luck: Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, Parcheesi etc.  This is just a fun, light game for families to enjoy.  When my son comes home for the weekend - he was a board game designer and now video game designer - will get his opinion and let you know what he thinks.",46.0

That's not to say the series is boring far from it you do wish though that they made the personalities of the character protagonist a little more original though with most animes and some shows that's pretty hard to do nowadays. I give kudos to keeping the animation the same as the previous LE and soundtrack score also fits nicely with the series,also you do get a special treat if you saw the first LE series as we see the return and cameos of characters from that series which is appreciated. The voice cast for both the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did a great job though with some of the previous LE characters they will of course sound somewhat different in the dub audio as the original voice actors and actress couldn't or wouldn't come back to dub their character voices though the people picked to dub those characters did a stellar job.So if you already have the first Last Exile series then this is a must have to add on to your anime collection or if you're just looking for a good anime series in general....",14.0

(No, the wheels don't make contact with the ground when the ladder is open.)+ The ladder is easy to open and close.+ Feels solid on the ground, no worries about tipping.Some information that should be but never is provided with the specs for ladders: at its maximum height, the top standing platform is 67 1/2"" from the ground. Folded, the ladder is 5' tall and 27"" wide at the base.The Airdeck could use some improvement. It's supposed to provide more stability for us when standing on the top platform, but the wobble makes me feel a little nervous. My husband double checked to make sure it was installed correctly. He lost his balance on the way down and grabbed it for support. It held tight, worked like it's supposed to, but we'd both like it better if it felt more solid.Still, I do like this ladder. We use it to change the light bulbs in our chandeliers, which was always a difficult task before. My husband used to lean an old ladder against the wall and have me stand below to hold it.

11411,11412,"I got a 4 ounce bag of these through a subscription box service and it was a challenge not to eat the whole bag in one sitting (each serving is one ounce).First, since there's currently not much product information on the page (including no ""Nutrition Facts"" box):Ingredients: Organic Quinoa (Whole Grain Quinoa, Quinoa Flakes, Quinoa Crisps), Peanuts, Tapioca Syrup, Raw Sugar, Crystallized Ginger (Ginger, Cane Sugar), Honey, Brown Rice Crisps, Almond Oil, Baking Soda, SaltThese are gluten free (certified) but obviously not vegan (honey). This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious.

11419,11420,"In Woody Allen's 2014 annual European set film, he goes back in time to the Roaring `20's.  Colin Firth plays Stanley Crawford who is a famous magician who goes by the name and disguise of Wei Ling Soo.  Stanley is approached by his good friend and fellow magician, Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to go to England and help him expose a supposed medium who he believes is hoodwinking the wealthy Catledge family into investing a fortune into an organization that promotes supernatural contact with the deceased.Stanley agrees, but like Howard, has a hard time finding the secrets.  In fact, he becomes convinced that the young American, Sophie (Emma Stone) is the real deal after she advances secrets about himself.  Marcia Gay Harden plays Sophie's mother, but really doesn't have much to do.  Jacki Weaver plays Grace Catledge, the widow who is trying to contact her late husband.  Hamish Linklater plays Brice Catledge, the playboy son who is smitten with Sophie and courts her with song and ukulele.This is lightweight stuff to be sure, but Allen offers a fine script and compelling characters to make it enjoyable.  Some of the best scenes are with Stanley and his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins) who lives near the Catledge's.  In one particular scene, Stanley argues with himself as to whether he should pursue Sophie.  Vanessa provides one liners that bounce back Stanley's own arguments.  It's funny and sweet.  Granted, we know all is not what it seems but I won't spoil the Agatha Christie-like reveal.  To be sure, this isn't one of Allen's masterpieces or even one of his best.  But I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially to Allen's fans.The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The technicians do a serviceable job transferring the film to the digital format.  The filmmakers chose a light hazy, sepia tone to the picture and it is nicely replicated here.  Close-ups are particularly good with fine detail and excellent skin tones consistent with the overall limitations.  Black levels are generally good.  Light grain can be seen throughout.  I was a little surprised to see a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track with this movie.  I seem to remember Allen almost always goes with stereo.  In any case the audio is very good, although the surrounds are mostly in play with the musical score and an early scene when Sophie and Stanley get caught in a thunderstorm.  The dialog centric movie is very clear with most of the audio coming from the center speaker.  The package includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include a piece called ""Behind the Magic"" and another ""On the Red Carpet"" as well as a trailer.",82.0

Not like the Neewer light, which felt pretty cheap and plasticy.✅ Easy to adjust brightness using dial. (see my video)✅ Gels (filters) are very useful. Cuts the glare.✅ Versatile: You can use lots of different kinds of batteries.  I personally use my Canon 70D batteries, since I have a lot of those already.  You can also use 6X AA batteries (not included).✅ Hot shoe mount fits my Canon 70D beautifully.✅ As far as I can tell, there's no high-pitched whine like I hear on other LED lights.✅ Very nice people at Selens.

11438,11439,"This was a christmas gift for our almost 3yo son from his aunt - He LOVED it - all present opening stopped for about 30 minutes since he simply could not wait for us to get this out of the box so he could play with it - we had to let him play with ½ of it b/c he was so excited!!  It was hands down the best gift this year.  It did take his dad a few minutes to assemble (like 10 minutes maybe) - but once put together it's worked almost flawlessly - my son LOVES using the elevator (& closing the gate every time) - then taking the car over with the crane - & he was able to use all of this entirely on his own after the first time we showed him.The only thing about this that could be designed a bit better would be the police car ramp (at the top of the elevator there's a ramp that holds a car - it's designed so when the car in the elevator is released onto the top level that ramp releases the car it's holding - so you end up with the police car chasing the yellow car).  It's a bit of a pain to load - I have to use both hands to keep the release in place (since otherwise the ramp doesn't stay up) - or I have to hold it up while my son puts it in.  This is the only bit he struggle to do on his own (he gets lucky every once in a while though).The pull out extension of the road on the bottom level is kinda weird - not sure why it's even necessary & can be a bit uncooperative at times when it comes to getting it back in - but it's not like that has any effect on the overall functionality of this product.  I will admit - I am concerned about how long the crane will last - the spring is quite strong - so when my son pulls it over to the other level it snaps back quite quickly.  Not concerned about it hurting my son - but am concerned that it will eventually crack the molded plastic or something....we'll see.But overall we're totally thrilled with this toy - as is my son.  Even we've had fun playing with this thing...it's great.  I imagine there may be some people who get some duds - whenever you involve mass production of molded plastic & a lot of little moving parts, that happens - but fisher price has always been pretty good at providing replacements for us when this has happened (can't speak to this specific product - but if you have trouble with yours I suggest just contacting fisher price - they'll probably send you a new one).

I've swapped out light switches with dimmers, crummy low-flow shower heads with nice big ones that have much better water pressure, etc.  I plan on taking it all with me when I leave - it's easy to swap out stuff like that.  Hence my desire to replace that god-awful 1980s thermostat with something like this - a digital, programmable modern-day thermostat.I swapped out thermostats before.  They're about as simple as it gets.  At least for old homes - there's only two wires to worry about.  Kill the power to the unit (use a power or line tester if you have one - they're cheap and come in handy) and stick the wires in the correct holes.The instructions were a little wordy / confusing.  It includes one giant sheet that shows all these different possible configurations of wiring your home may have.  If you've never done this before, it may be a little daunting.  But I managed to figure it out without destroying my apartment, so you probably will too!This unit has some neat functions to it, but they're not exactly intuitive.  Me, I don't need them;  I live alone (for now) so I just set it to the temperature I want when I walk in the door.  I turn everything off when I leave.  I told a friend recently that I do this, and they told me it may actually be cheaper to leave it on all day, rather than have the system fight to bring the temperature down at the end of the day.  So, with that said, I'll take a deeper dive into the programming features.  I like things to be simple - dead-easy to figure out and use.  This device is a little on the complex side, being that you have to hit several selections just to choose one option.  BUT - for me?  For the price?  I like it.  It's cheap - and it's modern - and it shows the temerature of my apartment versus the temperature I want it to be.  Living alone, I don't need much more.

11443,11444,"There have been many attempts to create educational ""games"" over the years. During the early days of home computing, most kids saw right through this (though I admit to quite enjoying Where in the World is Carmen San Diego before realizing it was teaching me stuff). Beyond those early days, I have very little exposure to learning games, but like many parents, I feel better with my child running ""educational"" software rather than midless space shooters. With that in mind, here are my impressions of this LeapFrog title...Last year, I got my then-3 year old son a LeapPad 2, and earlier this year I got to upgrade him to a LeapPad 3 so we could review it for Amazon. Since then, he has accumulated a small variety of cartridges for it, and he spends time on his ""green iPad."" He still prefers to watch YouTube toy review videos on his mom's real iPad, though.For his 4th birthday, he received a new Thomas the Tank Engine playset and this Rainforest cartridge. He was thrilled at the new Thomas set, but I managed to get him to spend a bit of time with the LeapPad. The game spends some time with cute animations an narrations explaining what it is about. He was not in the mindset to focus on all the talking and was trying to skip through them. Once the actual game began, it appeared to be a platform-style game. My son has not become video game obsessed yet (he still prefers real world play), so I helped him a bit with basic controls. The character walked through the rainforest until it touches an animal. Then, icons come up and dialog plays describing attributes of different types of animals. It then asks the player to choose what type of animal they just found. It followed up with a similar thing about types of feed (webbed, bird claws, etc.) and asks about that. At least in the first stage, it appeared to be a simple ""I'll tell you something, then ask you a question"" quiz program, disguised as a platform game.Ithought it was neat (though as a child, I would have found it a very un-fun video game, but certainly a more entertaining educational title). My son, however, soon went back to moving toy trains around his new multi-level playset. I expect he will revisit this title in coming months/years (it has a good age range), but it is clear that right now, video games won't pull him away from the Island of Sodor.I don't find anything particular bad about this title, and it seems an entertaining way to learn about animals and such. I suppose if you child is more in to rainforest stuff than trains, they would find this far more interesting.",58.0

11445,11446,"This watch is an eye catcher.  It's big and beefy and heavy... you know you are wearing a timepiece.  Everyone who noticed my new watch was asking about it and it really sets off a casual outfit.  Pros: Cool composite band - very trendy, but cool black. Skeleton see-through is very detailed and jeweled Waterproof, so no worries in common usage around water.  Cons: Big -- not for tiny man arms. Must wind....  Perhaps I've gotten too used to self winding Clasp can be difficult to open, but it never accidentally pops.  Update 6/2015 -- I've had this watch for a long time now and it still keeps time and looks like it did on day one.  It's striking -- I get a lot of comments on this watch, much more than any other watch I own.   It really has a great look and complements casual and business casual well. I've had to maintain the band's screws to keep them tight, recently using a threadlock gel to ensure they stay in without risk.  The bezel has zero marks on it and the glass is unscratched.    That's saying a lot -- with its size, it has taken a few impacts catching edges or doorframes.   The Skeleton nature of the face is intricate with its gems and must be what draws people to the face... either way, I don't have its equal on my nightstand and it brings me to looking at some of the Invicta Reserves as a future investment.

So many presets, likely several will be good for anyone's individual tastes.Cons: It's not a guitar, so think of it as the unique device that it is, and you'll be happy with it. The muting bar at the base of the strings doesn't always work, although I'm sure this can be tweaked.Batteries: about 5 hours of playing time for each 4 AA battery set. Seems a bit expensive. They could have made it use much less juice by auto-light dimming. Engineers can't foresee everything...Construction: I think 10:1 this is built in China. Oh... where to begin. The first one I had was with major issues. The CPU somehow was not operating, or the control board, and the device would reset during play, or not stay on one preset. Amazon was good enough to send me another one. Alas, this one has issues too. The whammy bar is a bit wobbly, and it can easily be activated even when it is not desired. I know this because the last one had a whammy bar you could set perpendicular to the device, and it would not activate at all. I'm debating whether to take it off permanently, or just return the device and forget about it. That said, I love the idea behind this device, it is an ideal.

11451,11452,"Revolving around four lost souls and set in two parallel worlds, Franklyn certainly isn't the Dark City/superhero movie it was rather misleadingly sold as but a rather more ambitious variation on that old arthouse favourite, the apparent strangers who are gradually drawn to the same place and event that will impact differently on each of their lives. There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away.Eva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played.It'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next.The Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film.",24.0

11465,11466,"This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.Villisca was a Thornton Wilder ""Our Town"" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. ""Villisca"" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.",59.0

One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving.  I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt.  So just be careful where/when you apply it.

When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower.  And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion.    In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this.

11492,11493,"This is a guitar I've had for, oh, at least 12 years now.  And it's held up.It's first important for me to mention that this is a very good guitar ***at this price point***.  Indeed, parts of this guitar certainly exceeded my expectations, with the fit and finish of the wood being really quite good.  On mine, some hardware (switches, dials, etc) was wobbly in the fittings so I did need to take some time to address those points.  On the other hand, the tuners were nice right out of the box.  So go figure.It also bears mentioning, clearly, that this is a Chinese product.  Sure, it says ""crafted"" in China, but it's still not of this shore so if that bothers you, well, there you go.

However,  like other Chinese ""crafts,"" sometimes you can see the choices they made that gets you to that attractive price point.  For instance, this has a rosewood fingerboard.  Rosewood in and of itself isn't bad, but I don't think it's the best choice on this style of guitar (my opinion, don't shoot me).  It's cheaper than the alternatives though, so that's probably why it's there.I've seen some consistency issues across the line as well.  For instance, the color of mine is more of a washed out blue, approaching a bluish lavender in fact.Tone on this is VERY surprising.  It sounds great!

It's going to try harder and it brings something unique.  Ditch the factory strings and put some good 'uns on there, and I think you'll be happy with the result.For an informal instrument where you don't feel like spending the green for a name brand, this one works quite well.  Again, it's fun for me to just jam on without worrying about turning heads because of the name on headpiece.  I like this instrument.  A lot.",67.0
11493,11494,"This review is for the 31"" Long Curly Gold Yellow WigFree product provided for evaluation and review.Wow, this wig is gorgeous.  It is a very nice sunny blond.  It should work for blond yellow cosplays.It is nice and full, and the wig-cap inside it is tightly woven and lace at the crown, making it an easy wig to sew into if that treatment is needed for a costume. I also like that they made the interior a light beige and that really helps it look more natural. It does adjust inside.The hair is quite natural looking - my natural blond hair is in picture beside it - it compares very well to natural hair, it is just a bit shinier.It’s easy to comb and work with.  The waves are loose and the cut is long layers, which give it some added volume.It can be styled with setting lotion and a hairdryer on cool or no heat, or set and curled and left to dry.  It has retained it’s out of box waviness well for me.It should fit most adults.  It fits me perfectly and I am a cap size MEDIUM with a head diameter of 22.5.”  It would stretch a bit more if needed.  It does have straps so it will adjust down to about a 21”.  I think any smaller than that would need a smaller long wig.It can be pinned if needed as the hair is a bit weighty from length, but generally it stays on very well, but it might need a few pins if you plan on being active.  That’s normal for long wigs. You’d want to use blond ones with this wig.  The bangs cover the hairline well.As I mentioned, it is a bit weighty in the back from length - blonde bobby pins will help secure it if needed.  I recommend them for us with this wig.",51.0

11495,11496,"I bought this for my Canon 7D and have had it for over 5 months. I wanted to protect my camera from nicks and scratches since I regularly bring my camera on my hikes -- and this skin does a good job of it.Pros----- ProtectionThe skin is very thick, which will not only protect the camera from nicks and scratches but help dampen the impact from bumps. (The thick skin does make the already large 7D a little pudgy.)- DurableThe skin's held up very well to all the frequent handling I subject it. There are no rips, tears, or any form of degradation. The previous skin I got for my Canon XSi held up to years of heavy use. This one looks to be equally durable.- Accurate CutoutsThe cutouts (for the screen, mode dial, lens mount, battery compartment, etc.) line up perfectly. Unlike my previous skin, this one lets me change lenses easily because the skin doesn't obstruct the area where the lens meets the mount.Cons----- Hard Screen Protector Slides AroundI'm worried the hard screen protector does more harm than good since it slides around and could potentially scratch the LCD screen (even if the LCD had a regular ""soft"" screen protector on since the very edges of the LCD aren't covered). Forget the Hard Screen Protector; a regular screen protector (included) will do the job just fine.- Buttons Not Clearly LabeledThis problem seems specific to only the skins for certain camera models. On the 7D, the labels on the buttons are imprinted as part of the molding, but they are barely legible.---The Bottom Line: The Delkin Snug-it Pro is a well-made and durable product that offers the camera very good protection. The only shortcoming (for the skin for the Canon 7D) is the labels for the buttons are not clearly labelled (not a problem for me personally because I already know my way around the camera).",41.0

11499,11500,"I have been using these blades for about two years now, and find that I get an excellent shave from the blades.  I have a very tough beard, and find these blades do well at cutting, but I do have to make two or three passes in some areas to get a good shave, but I have this issue with other razors also.  I use the power razor with the vibration on.  I was skeptical of this idea, and never tried it before purchasing one of the razors about two years ago that was a great deal, and found the vibration was more beneficial than I expected.I also wanted to point out that the area above the blades flips back allowing you to shave the area above your lip directly below your nose.  I did not read the instructions and was initially concerned that the razor would not shave that location, but it works well once you know how the razor blade operates.Obviously, these are not cheap disposable razors.  One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  I generally shave 5 - 6 days per week, and can get at least 5 to 6 weeks out of one blade.  I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.I've used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.  I would definately recommend this blade to anyone who wants a good shave, and is mindful of the value in buying good blades over cheap blades.",25.0

11506,11507,"I transport a lot of electronic equipment for my work, often cross-country. Courtesy of careless baggage handlers and drivers, I have watched my precious equipment thrown to ground from baggage holds, tossed into trunks and simply dropped – once into a pool of Philadelphia slush. No harm came to my equipment, though I can’t say the same of my heart which stopped beating during these incidents. I have come to appreciate hard cases. Xsories is a new entry into a market dominated by Pelican. Pelican is a premium brand and you pay for its stature. But you get an excellent case. Xsories offers three cases, all of which are worthy competitors to Pelican and have lower prices for equivalent sizes. The XSories Big Black Box 2.0 Shockproof Waterproof Storage Case feels as sturdy as a Pelican case. Made of “ ultra high-impact ABS plastic”, it doesn’t flex much when pressed. At some point, I will figure out a kind of torture test like dropping it with an unused camera inside on to a concrete floor. But visually and to the touch, the case feels strong. The latches are positive and there is a hasp for a lock. The case may also be fitted with a strap which is a definite advantage over any of my Pelican cases. There is also a grip handle. The inside of the Big Black Box is not particularly commodious, measuring about 10 x 7 x 3 inside. The interior is fitted with a foam insert that has been pre-cut into small cubes. You just pluck out the cubes to create a space shaped to fit your components. This means putting some effort into designing your inside to get maximum utility from the space. There is a foam layer on the bottom of the case and inside the lid. Your equipment inside is going to be well protected from shock. This is an all-climate case with an operating range of -40f through +176f. The case is described as “water-proof”, though I am not sure just what the limits of that claim are. I do know t7hat heavy rain and winter slush will probably not penetrate. There is also an air pressure compensation valve, though I have never knowingly used this feature on a case. Overall, Xsories has created a very worthy and less expensive competitor to Pelican and other “premium” brands, though you might want to consider the next step up in their line, the “Huge Black Box” which offers more interior space. It all depends on your needs. The “Big Black Box” weighs less than 2 pounds, the “Huge Black Box” weighs slightly over 4 pounds, which is also a considceration. I like this case. So far I think it compares very well to the more expensive Pelican.Jerry",89.0

11528,11529,"“Gone Girl” is a David Fincher thriller, and that will tell you something about the film. This is a story about the “missing Amy,” which is dark, twisted and unpredictable. I am not saying this is one of the greatest mysteries ever filmed. It simply is not, because the script is, if scrutinized closely, full of illogical things. Still, it is darkly entertaining enough to forget these plot holes, thanks to the slick direction and fine acting.The story starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. The police investigation starts, followed by heavy press coverage. The Nick slowly realizes that despite their five-year marriage, he knew so little about his wife. Not only that; people start to think that Nick is not what he seems.So what really happened? “Gone Girl” takes time in unfolding its complicated story, and maybe too much time. (It runs about 150 minutes.) But don’t ever expect something like “Zodiac,” or a mystery based on realism. What happens in the last 30 minutes of “Gone Girl” is so incredible.I’m giving four stars because of some of the effective performances from the cast, including Carrie Coon as Nick’s twin sister Margo.

There are a couple of other no-name switchers, that are otherwise identical, being sold without the power adapter. Obviously, having the power adapter is a plus. The unit is easy to set up and install, has the advantage of having the HDMI output on the opposite side as three of the HDMI inputs, and it has an IR remote sensor and a remote. I would worry more about the remote failing than the switch itself. So I would suggest making sure that you enter the remote commands in a learning remote if you have one, and use that remote instead of the supplied remote. In a pinch it has manual switching on the unit also. All easy to setup and has worked just fine for all kinds of HDMI devices plugged into it for display on my TV. RECOMMENDED.",28.0
11543,11544,"The TAN FURREAL FRIENDS HOP 'N CUDDLE BUNNY from Hasbro is a great toy to give away as a gift at Easter. The bunny runs on 3 AA batteries, a set of which is included when you purchase the toy. The fur on this toy mechanical bunny is very soft, which does make it good for cuddling. When you press down on the bunny's back, it begins hopping around in a kind of circle. It also makes a series of different clicking sounds that kind of sound like the bunny is sniffling or nibbling (though they kind of sound like bunny noises, they don't really sound much like the rabbits I've worked with before-they sound more like Bugs Bunny eating a carrot than anything else). There's a switch where you can turn the bunny off if the noise or the hopping becomes too much of a nuisance. The toy is recommended for children four and up. This would be a good Easter gift for a younger child and it appeals to girls more than boys.",26.0
11544,11545,"UPDATE - February 2, 2015    After I wrote my review the manufacturer of this bag had the bag redesigned so that the zipper opening runs the full width of the top of the bag (and then a bit) to allow for easy insertion of your computer.  A copy of the new version landed on my porch yesterday. Kudos for a great response!  (Now if they had only changed that lining!)    ORIGINAL REVIEW    I love the look of this stylish black/dark gray denim [[ASIN:B00QM3BH0G Casual Messenger Crossbody Bag Shoulder Bag]]. Loaded with pockets and zippered compartments, the bag features a diagonal zipper compartment on the top flap and an adjustable strap of heavy duty webbing.  The bag is well constructed of mostly heavy duty materials and features attractive antiqued brass metal fittings.  There are, however, some things that I do not like about this bag.    First, the product page gives the bag's dimensions as 14.8x11.8x4.3 inches and clearly states that the bag will hold a 15 inch laptop.  I know of no way at all that one can fit 15 inches of inflexible material into a space only 14.8 inches long.  Clearly, this must be a typo.  Accordingly, I tested the bag on both my daughter's 14 inch Alienware computer and a 13.3 inch netbook.  The 14 inch Alienware simply would not go into the bag, no matter how we turned it. (The zipper opening is only about 12 inches.)  I did get the netbook into the bag by putting one corner in first and then turning the device, but the case did scrape against the zipper.  Frequently putting the netbook into the bag and removing it would certainly result in a severely marred netbook case.  An iPad does fit adequately.    The exterior of the bag is made of 100% cotton denim, which makes it washable.  The lining, however, is a heavy, brown, not particularly attractive nylon of not-particularly great quality.  The two fabrics have different shrink rates, so while you can in theory wash this bag, you can also expect to find your lining larger than the bag itselfafter you do so.  A cotton fabric would have been much more attractive and easily eliminated that problem.    Grandma's $0.02 - Nice stylish, heavy duty bag.",65.0
11545,11546,"This is a fairly entertaining retread of familiar territory, and I did find parts to be extremely moving (especially when dealing with loss).However, the book failed to impress me for a number of reasons:1/ A slew of cliched situations and plot devices (ancient prophecy, circle of power, unnamed evil afoot, etc. )2/ The characters were entirely one dimensional, and it was apparent at first encounter who was good and who was evil. No shades of grey.3/ Each character's motivation was similarly obvious. Greed/power for the evil, and duty/honor for the good.4/ The major plot line was extremely weak, was resolved with minimal fuss, and ended with a just-as-weak cliffhanger.This is not epic GRRM, and neither is it even close to the more mass market efforts by Goodkind.

It took us a few tries to get the hang of cutting the right size bags and then using the sealer, but once we figured it all out we became vacuum-sealing fools! The two biggest mistakes we made to start off were cutting the bags too short (not enough room for the sealer to properly do its thing) and cutting the bags to hastily, leaving a ragged edge that also got in the way. Once we took our time and did it right, all went smoothly. While we did receive this roll of bag material gratis from the seller, we put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed and my statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for affordable vacuum food sealer bag material of this style and size, for use similar to what I have described above, then we recommend this bag roll from VonShef based on our experience with it.

11552,11553,"The Ernie Ball MVP is a great volume pedal. I am used to a Morley Little Alligator volume pedal, which is optical, not controlled by a volume pot. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. For instance, the string that controls the volume pot on the MVP will eventually fray and need to be replaced. Likewise, the pot itself may go bad over time – hopefully not during a live show!The optical is certainly more reliable, but I’ve noticed that the sweep on the Morley is not as smooth as the sweep on the MVP. There are advantages and disadvantages to this as well. For instance, the Morley is great for cello-like single note attacks. The MVP is far better (IMHO) for ambient swells. I use ambient swells in the church setting where I play, almost like giving the keyboard player a break when he/she is covering more piano parts and we need the added pads.The MVP, like the Morley, has a minimum knob which allows you to set a lower volume in the toe up position. Personally, I have never used this feature as I prefer to do swells from no volume to full volume. That being said, I can see where this feature would be very helpful before OR after your drives. Before the drives you could use it to adjust gain/distortion levels – after the drives you could use it as an overall volume boost. The MVP also has the added feature of a decibel boost knob. This is great, especially in conjunction with the minimum knob, or by itself if you need the added gain. Personally, I don’t use this feature as well but I can still see the added benefit.What is also nice about this pedal is the fact that it is buffered/powered (9v). So, if you use the tuner out (as I do) you don’t lose high end frequencies. In other words, it doesn’t suck your tone.All in all, this is a great volume pedal and I have it secure on my pedal board. I won’t say that I’m not apprehensive about the string eventually fraying and breaking, because I am. However,it is especially smooth and works most excellently for ambient volume swells.

11592,11593,"Collecting: X-Men (2013) #18-22In the previous adventure, [[ASIN:0785189726 X-Men Volume 3: Bloodline]], the all-female X-Men's adventure was rooted firmly on planet earth.  In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.The Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.These issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.If you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.  The next adventure for this X-team can be found in [[ASIN:0785197265 X-Men Vol. 5: The Burning World]]",41.0

The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.I love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home.

Though the HK250 is capable of streaming media audio, I'm not impressed by its music acoustic qualities; the feature ranks as mere gimmick on monaural devices, though I applaud the Bluetooth specification which enables it since, being a speaker it may as well play back media audio - it's convenient.My favorite thing about the HK250 is the spoken audible cues; connection status, battery level, the phone number of the incoming calls and a subtle ""double-blip"" which indicates when the call recipient picks up the line.The finish is unappealing. I thought there was a thin, transparent piece of protective plastic to peel off the surface, but there's not. The plastic face readily shows finger smudges.Overall, this is fine for smaller ears.

While this is a fun game (and the deck of cards on dice gimmick is actually pretty cool) it's not quite as fun as Yahtzee just because it feels a lot less strategic.

Not that a game of luck isn't fun, it's just not quite as much fun as another, existing game of luck involving dice.

11655,11656,"Unless you have a cabinet saw or a panel saw, it can be difficult to make accurate cuts on plywood sheets.  I've tried several jigs, commercial and homemade, none of which have been entirely satisfactory. The Kreg I bought most recently has a very complicated setup, will only cut a foot from the edge, and once set up, you can't swap saws. It wouldn't fit my Porter-Cable trim saw, either. The best jigs are those in which the saw is locked to the track, and can't wander to either side. Most I've seen require a dedicated saw and track, like the DeWalt and the Festool, which run $600 and up. Way up.So here's this inexpensive saw guide that's adaptable to just about any saw, can be attached in minutes, and can be adjusted to fit any rail or reasonable thick straight edge up to 3-1/2"" wide, and it costs a faction of the other guides. I mounted my Porter-Cable, clamped my cheap straight edge on a leftover piece of 1/2"" ply,  adjusted the plate to fit my straightedge, and did a test cut. Result: No wandering, and a near perfect cut.I've been having my neighborhood lumberyard do my plywood cutting for me, which they do happily and accurately, but the general purpose blade they have mounted on their table saw doesn't leave the cleanest edge. Fine for construction, not so much for cabinetry.  I can make much better finish cuts at home now, using this jig, a pair of sawhorses, and a specialized plywood cutting blade. It's an excellent value.",37.0

You will need a full tower for this cooler to fit- Expensive.Conclusion:Since the ends justify the means in this case, I still went with the expensive, hard to install fan.

11658,11659,"Some of the reviews scared me, but the Vue was pleasantly surprising.  It is very similar to the extended height chair that I use with my standing height desk at work.CONSTRUCTIONCompared to other office chairs that I've put together, the Vue was a bit simpler because more of it was already attached.  All it takes is shoving a few things together and driving some screws.  Easy!BUILD QUALITYWhile the Vue is not the fanciest chair, it has that industrial feel of office furniture that will last forever.  The metal is thick and the hydraulic element shows no sign of strain when I adjust it.  The metal ring used for the foot rest is very nice and surprisingly slick, though I may just be too used to seeing my nasty corroded one at work.A weak point might be the mesh back, which I could see tearing or fraying at some point because it is just a sheet of fabric.  The cushion also might wear quickly.  I will update my review if I have any issues over time.COMFORTIf you've never sat in an extended height chair, it is important to know that the foot rest (metal ring) is adjustable, allowing you to set it to a height that is comfortable and does not cut off leg circulation.  This chair's ring is a standard diameter, which means that the heels rest a bit behind the knees.  I don't know why this is the standard, but a wider ring might be more comfortable.  The metal is nicely rounded, but I find that setting my bare feet on it is not comfortable for long stretches.  This is not an issue for using it at work.The chair itself is firm, but in a good way, with a proper amount of cushion.  The back is nice and the mesh keeps my back cooler in the Summer.  It is not the fancy mesh material that is more springy and supportive, but it works well.SUMMARYThe Vue is a good standard extended-height office chair.  The build quality is solid, it is simple to use, and generallycomfortable.  It is not likely to make anyone jealous, but it also won't make you jealous of them.",46.0
11659,11660,"Farberware BBQ Instant Read Thermometer with Large Digital Face, by Farberware.When I received this thermometer from Amazon, I was a bit disappointed. It is 1 ¼"" wide and 5"" long. I already have one of these small ones that are more difficult to read as I get older. The write-up on this BBQ thermometer gave the impression that it was larger.  The product description said that it would be 10"" long. This is false advertising by Amazon, and one reason that I hate to buy things from a catalog. If it is broken or not as advertised, you have to go through the headache of returning it through the mail. At least if you buy something in an old style brick and mortar store, you can go there and return it more easily. In the same shipment, I also received from Amazon a broken Salter kitchen scale that was made of cheap plastic with chrome paint. The description of that item gave the impression that it was chrome covered metal, not plastic.  More false or misleading advertising by Amazon.  I give up. I will shop at a local kitchen store instead, where I can see what I am getting, and can evaluate the product in the store. Fortunately, I can still drive a car and I do not have to depend on catalogs.

That feature alone is reason enough to buy this, though it is on the pricey side.Beyond that the night light and lullaby buttons are great.

11662,11663,"I do a lot of roasting and smoking. Of course I have any number of racks and trays for that purpose, depending on the meat and its size/weight. Racks don't always hold the meat where I want and they aren't easy to clean up when covered in juices, sauce, and fat that has been burned on over several hours. For a long time, I resorted to using makeshift racks made from folded and stacked aluminum foil, but this can also be sticky and messy, and it is wasteful and tedious.Well, thanks to the roasting laurel, no more piles of foil will be necessary. I tried this right away on my toughest recipe, involving bourbon, brown sugar, and spare ribs (right: sugar, more sugar, and fat). The laurel bends to about any shape needed and then holds that shape, sitting neatly in most any tray. I put it in a foil lined pan, plopped my ribs on top and slathered on the sauce. They were cooked over three hours, turned several times, always adding sauce on top each time. As usual, the drippings and sauces/sugars formed an eighth of an inch deep pool at the bottom of the tray, eventually drying, crusting, and burning to a crisp black. (The ribs turned out great, thank you very much.) After I removed the ribs, I let the tray cool to room temperature. When I went to remove the laurel, it pulled right out from the tray, leaving the blackened sauce and crusted foil behind (with a pretty cool leaf pattern). I started to soak it in water, but most everything floated right off. I was a little annoyed by the large number of nooks and crannies between the leaves and the indentation where the leaves meet the stem, but no scrubbing was necessary - just soapy sponge and even rubbing. I estimate cleaning time of the laurel compared to a typical rack to be about one-fourth as time intensive, and probably one-fiftieth energy intensive. The fact that it didn't get stuck to the sugar and fat hardened to a black tar like coating was impressive enough. This thing is great, and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. I can't wait to try this during next summer's smoking season!",55.0
11663,11664,"I was surprised to see that the non-stick coated plates are supposedly dishwasher safe. I love things that can go in the dishwasher so the first thing I did was run all the plates through the dw. When my husband emptied the dw it looked like soap has stuck and crusted all over the plates, so he left them in and ran them again. I was the next to empty the dw and when I opened it the plates looked like soft pretzels covered with salt. I took them out to wash off what I thought was soap by hand and it wasn't soap, it was some weird metal oxidation all over the non-stick side of every plate. I had to scrub it off, and it wouldn't all come off, and it left marks behind.When the plates were dry we used it to make hot sandwiches once and to make waffles once. We have a [[ASIN:B00006F2MD Cuisinart Dual-Sandwich Nonstick Electric Grill]] which I am not thrilled with, but this Black and Decker makes it look good by comparison.

I really like the squeegee side, which I used both to push heavy snow off the car and to clear snow from my windows. The brush is pretty good too, makes it easier to break apart the snow stuck to the car. The scraper is EXCELLENT. Probably the best scraper I have used. It easily scraped the ice of my windshield and windows with ease.I took off one star because I did have some issues with this snow broom. First, I wish the brush head was wider. At only a little over 7"" wide, you have to make several passes get the snow off sections of your car. Second, the brush head and the scraper are not level on mine, which gets annoying when I have to rotate it when I flip it over to use the other side. It doesn't lay flat because if the brush is flat on the ground the scraper is turned about 45 degrees, so it balances on it's edge. Also, the soft cushion grip slides, especially when the metal handle is really cold.For the $5 price it is excellent. I wouldn't pay more than that for it.

The magnification mirror we currently have in the bathroom is not real nice, and I thought this might be a good improvement. We found it has some nice features, but I'm not sure if it will end up being something that's used continuously.The magnification works well, and it works for both close-up jobs (like removing something from an eye) and makeup. She also liked the different lighting options. It's amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I'm not quite sure I'd want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that's not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity.

11734,11735,"As a long-standing fan of Elizabeth George's Lynley / Havers series, I have not been disappointed with the writer's latest conrtibution to it. What a great novel this is! I don't want to give out any spoilers, so here is just a list of what you can expect to find in BELIEVING THE LIE:  - the novel is set mostly in Cumbria (although parts of it take place in London, too). I don't think Elizabeth George had written about Cumbria before this. I know how carefully this author researches the places where she sets the action of her novels, which makes you feel like you have actually visited Cumbria after you read this novel.  - there is a highly dysfunctional family in the centre of the narrative. This family's seemingly picture-perfect existence conceals a multitude of dark secrets. As always, George offers extremely convincing psychological insights into the personalities of her characters.  - in this novel, we see interactions between Barbara Havers and the wife of her neighbor who has returned to her husband and daughter. If you are a fan of the series and were shocked at how the last novel, THIS BODY OF DEATH, ended, I know that you must be dying to find out how this new set of circumstances plays out and how Barbara will deal with the presence of Azhar's wife so close to herself. By the way, Barbara is still working to improve her appearance, as she started doing in the last novel. The result is always comical and sad at the same time.  - Lynley and Isabelle Ardery continue to explore their mutual attraction, even though tensions grow between them. I imagine that many of the long-standing fans of the series are not exactly enamored of this plot line. However, we all have to recognize that George does everything to prevent the series from becoming stale. And she manages brilliantly to keep the interest of her readers at its peak.  - Deborah and Simon play an important part in this novel as they help Lynley conduct a covert investigation in Cumbria. They are going through yet another of the many crises their relationship has undergone over the years.  - Rodney Aronson, the sleazy tabloid reporter from IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ENEMY, appears in this novel, too. He is just as obsessed with finding scandalous stories and just as addicted to chocolate as he was before. George also introduces a hilarious character of a young Jewish reporter who is trying to please Rodney and find a stiry that would be juicy enough for the tabloid.  And there is a lot more to this great novel that is funny, mysterious, shocking, gripping and full of suspense, all at the same time. It always feels like one has to wait forever for Elizabeth George to release one of her new novels. However, the wait in the case of BELIEVING THE LIE was absolutely justified.",73.0

11754,11755,"We have 4 dogs, two who love the squeeker toys and two who are afraid of them.  My review is for Min. Schnauzer who is 11 but acts like she's 6 mo. when presented with a ""squeeker"" and my male black lab who spends hours and hours just laying and squeeking.  The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time.  I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it.  As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres.  The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us. We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun.",22.0
11755,11756,"The best thing I can say is this is relatively inexpensive.  My problem is moisture, not particulates - actual water droplets coming through the system.  Its been a losing battle to getting these out of my air, and this did not fix that problem. I live in western Washington state and the humidity here is very high, I have an ""array"" of two air filters (counting this) and just added a third filter with an additional desiccant water removal stage. That seems to have done the trick, no more water droplets in my automotive paint. The desiccant is at the end of the filters and the little beads don't last very long, so there is still a lot of moisture coming through the water separators/filters. The compressor, by the way has an automatic drain on it and is 50' away from the regulator, so I think I've done everything there I can on that end. I am open to suggestions.  And this comes with no mounting bracket or way to mount and support it.  I have this on the inlet end of things, so that means the air hose is supported by the pipe nipple coming off the outlet with this filter hanging in between.",26.0

11775,11776,"I put this pump in a little over a year ago.The Good:Quiet on lower speeds.Moves plenty of water.Nice to have the timer and everything built in.  I created a custom control unit with arduinos and home automation software, which I use to manage the pump.  Total cost was about $300 to set up.The Bad:One of the features this pump has is the SVRS protection, which is there to prevent people from getting stuck on or in the drain by the suction.  It's a good safety feature, however most pool cleaners will trigger this and shut the pump off.  We are unable to reliably use our pool cleaner because of this.  The only time it is disabled is during priming, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity, just the timeout between the next start.  If it happens too many times it just plain disables the pump until manually reset. Additionally it has started triggering all of the time now, on non-pool cleaner inputs.The fan is not fully enclosed, there have been a few lizards who have snuck in there, and not had a good time.  Now the fan rattles from being knocked around/nicked.The on pump menu control is a huge pain to navigate.  There are two buttons, select, and enter.  You have to use select in the main menus, and enter in the sub menus.  If you screw up pressing the wrong one it tells you INVALID KEY, and pauses all input for a few seconds, as you wonder why they didn't just make one button.  One is in the middle of the navigation, so you would think you would use that most of the time, no, its the one to the upper left that you use more frequently.Not specifically the pumps fault (doesn't impact the rating), but mine didn't come with all the required parts.Summary:If I had it to buy over again, I would probably look at the non-SVRS version of this pump, or look into getting a Hayward unit.  You can turn off the SVRS for a period of time to use apool cleaner.",38.0

11790,11791,"I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down.When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.",54.0

I am not sure if there have been any strides made over the centuries, or even the last few years, in the actual sharpness of a pencil. No one as far as I know has stated that they would not have written the same masterpiece if their pencil had not been as sharp as it was after using blah blah blah. But modern technology has allowed some pretty mind boggling advances in how sophisticated the actual sharpening device can be.The Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC seems to have covered every single base other than having a small internal camera and external LCD screen to display the tip of your pencil actually being sharpened as you do it. The case is very attractive, and it does boast some real world features that are both thoughtful and handy. These include rubber suction feet to keep the sharpener from moving around while you use it, a rotating guide that allows pencils of various diameters to be smoothly and accurately inserted -- got to have pencil insertion accuracy, a sensor that stops the sharpening when the pencil has reached a fine tip, no over sharpening, removable cutting blades that can be switched out if and when the pencil sharpener starts to falter after the millionth pencil, anti microbial coatings to help protect you from your less hygienic work mates, a nifty blue light, and a very handy and large front removable shavings drawer.I don't know if my own scribblings will ever live up to the potential of the Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC, but I am ready to find any excuse I can now to use a pencil. Seriously, this is a great pencil sharpener, I can't really imagine how anyone could improve on the ideas and design of this unit. For me it's definitely a keeper. RECOMMENDED.",31.0

11801,11802,My wife and I like to have a cup of coffee about midafternoon to relax and enjoy a cookie with it.  We try various types of cookies and Pepperidge Farm is one of the best.  There are 8 cookies in each bag and they taste very good.  Each cookie has 130 calories and 50 of them come from fat.  They also contain 10 sugars.While the cookies are delicious and were crispy and sweet I was disappointed in one simple thing.  Why does the photograph of the cookie on the front of the package have more macadamia nuts than four cookies in the bag?  I rate this as a 5 star cookie that loses one star for false advertising.  Make the photo look like the real cookie in the bag.We purchased ours at a local store for a lot less money. (42% of the price listed here),28.0
11802,11803,"~BACKGROUND~I purchased these for my 2 month old son to use in aiding his motor skill development.~PROS~- Cute and colorful eye catching designs.- Wrist rattles can be used for more than just the wrist - they can be attached to carriers, playpads, etc.~CONS~- Foot rattles are hard to put on initially and then remain stretched out and too big.- Foot rattles are not designed like a sock with a curve to them.  The are merely tubes of fabric.  Perhaps this contributes to why they do not stay on very well?- Foot rattles keep coming off.  There is minimal elasticity in the socks and they keep sliding down.  Even over socks they just keep sliding down.  When my son starts moving his feet around the rattles are hanging off or just come off altogether.- Rattles are a bit too quiet.- The wrist rattle cuffs are a bit on the small side.- The foot rattles are a bit on the large side.~CONCLUSION~I think the it is a great concept, but definitely could be executed better.Unfortunately, my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles.  This is strange because he loved looking at and touching similar looking toys.  But he does enjoy chewing on the wrist rattles.I would not recommend these and would recommend spending your ~$20 on something else.",43.0

11806,11807,"This video camera is pretty freakin' amazing, I have to say. My last video camera was from years ago (so long that it used tape!), so this was my first experience with a digital video camera. I don't think I have to say I came away impressed.First of all, I wasn't looking forward to having to buy a bunch of storage for a digital video camera. Storage is expensive, plus keeping track of cards is just annoying. Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered that this video camera has almost 100 GB of internal storage! That's enough for almost 40 hours of recording, which is more than I'd use it before pulling the data off.When you take it out of the box, the way the camera is built is a little disconcerting. This camera has pretty incredible image stabilization, which prevents your video from reflecting the natural shakiness of your arm. But to do that, the internal bits of the camera float around inside. Basically, when you take it out and hear things thumping around in the camera you're probably going to think it's broken. But no, that's how it's supposed to be, and you'll get used to it.My favorite feature of the camera is its built-in projector. No longer do you have to wait to unload video from the memory card before watching! The projector is such a great feature, and it works very well. Image quality is sharp and it's pretty intuitive to use.Overall, I'm impressed with this camera. It is on the expensive side, but you're getting a lot for your money here, as this thing is feature-packed.",46.0

11817,11818,"When it comes to Table Tennis Training Robots, iPong is known for the various products.Of course, the products can go anywhere from $40 to over a $100 but for those wanting a cheaper alternative may want to give the iPong Mini Ball holder a chance.For its pricepoint, it's not going to hold over a 100 balls (it holds 20), no accessories or special spins, but still the iPong Mini Ball holder is great for its simple use and that is for people who want to train when it comes to aiming and targeting their shots.The iPong Mini Ball Holder takes four AA batteries  - Note that the battery tray is held by a screw, takes 40mm (not 38mm) Ping Pong Balls and put 20 in there and turn the power on and you're ready to go.Balls are consistent and it's a lot of fun to play and use and see if you can land a ball on the top opening.Again, this is great for simplicity but if you want more of a challenge, check out the iPong Topspin Table Tennis Training Robot which holds more balls (110), has more features (comes with a remote) and cost the same as the iPong Mini Ball Holder.  It's just that it's flourescent green and not as cool looking as this iPong Mini Ball Holder.Nevertheless, it all comes down to you and your training.  If you want more challenge but more bang for under $40, then definitely go with the iPong Topspin Training Robot, as this iPong Mini Ball Holder may be too simplistic for its price and doesn't hold as many balls.

11821,11822,"In a way Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very ambitious movie, probably more ambitious than her previous ""The Hurt Locker"" in that her new thriller deals with a more recent event: death of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.For some (or most) potential viewers, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" will not be what they expect. If you are looking for a more dramatic and action-packed fact-based thriller, you may find Bigelow's slow-paced narrative style frustrating. Sometimes there are so many details going on, that though each sequence is absorbing, the 157-film film itself feels too long and uneven.Jessica Chastain plays Maya, the film's protagonist about whom we know nothing about, except that she is determined to track down Osama bin Laden. Chastain's strong acting effectively shows us the change her character must undergo over the course of the investigation, though the reason for her determination, or obsession, is not explained.Some reviewers compare the semi-documentary approach of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to that of ""Zodiac,"" a David Fincher film made in 2007. In both, we audiences know where the film is going. We expect the process of revealing the truth to be concise and clear (possibly with a character we can identify with), while the film gives only detailed accounts of events, which mat look real but feel drawn-out.Though I prefer a more accessible approach with a faster narrative and characters with back stories, I found ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to be a rewarding experience, even though I admit I had to be very patient at times trying to follow the narrative thread.",18.0

11827,11828,"I have been interested in making my own sausage for a while now, which meant I needed a meat grinder.  I was tempted by those big metal hand-cranked grinders just because they look cool, but finally decided on function over form and got this Food Grinder attachment for my KitchenAid, along with the [[ASIN:B00004SGFQ Sausage Stuffer]].  I know that this grinder has been hit-and-miss with a lot of people.  I did some research on how best to use it, and followed the advice of chilling both the meat and the grinder before use.  I cut my meat into small, serviceable chunks and I was ready to go.  I am happy to report that I am on the ""hit"" side of hit-and-miss.  Both the grinder and sausage stuffer worked just fine, and I had a great time making my sausage.  Granted, everything wasn't entirely smooth; it took some practice and experience to get used to just how much meat I could put in the grinder at once, how fast I could run the mixer, and how much pressure I could exert on the plunger to keep the meat grinding steady into the sausage casings.  If I pressed to hard or went to fast, the meat had a tendency to squish up the sides.  I did have a slight residue of that famous ""food safe grease"" on the grinder after I was finished, but it was a tiny amount and didn't get on the meat.  I wonder if chilling the actual grinder before using it helped out with that problem?  Either way it washed off easily.  I wouldn't recommend the ""KitchenAid Food Grinder"" for anyone doing heavy-duty mince-making.  This is not a commercial-grade product, and doing more than a few pounds is going to take a long time.

11830,11831,"Joanna Barsh, a 30 year veteran of McKinsey, takes the reader on a journey through self paced and extremely insightful exercises to arrive at a better place for leadership and self awareness in this easy to read but challenging book.  Barsh begins by focusing on the element of centering.  Centering crossed my path as ""centering prayer"" several years ago, and revolves around self awareness, stillness and connection as well as grounding.  Barsh crosswalks this meditative practice to an active implementation in ""Centered Leadership"".The book begins with a useful introduction to centered leadership, and an introduction to the five components which make up the centered leadership facets:* Framing - self awareness, pausing and adaptability* Connecting - Trust relationships, networks and community, sponsorships* Engaging - Presence, ownership and taking risks and action* Energizing - Energy balance, recovery and sustaining practices* Meaning - Happiness, core strengths and purposeBarsh then walks the reader through each of the five elements, accompanied by a series of self reflective and team exercised designed to awaken and develop each of the five facets.  At the end, she hopes that he reader will have improved their leadership impact, self-fulfillment and resilience.Ultimately, the book is a useful tool - as much for self awareness and self development as to provide enlightening leadership techniques.  Barth seems to embrace the approach that to lead, one must first take care of themselves and understand (perhaps even ""center"") themselves for maximum effectiveness.  It is a worthwhile read, and the exercises are thought provoking and useful.",30.0

All but one of their recommendations includes both cover art and a full page of the comic for the reader to consider.  If the series or graphic novel has won awards these are noted next before topics of an educational nature are listed along with a rare website that expands upon these often very basic life lessons.  ""Heads Up"" lists some issues that might concern some parents like name calling or violence or potty humor for example.  ""What's Next..."" suggests other comic books or graphic novels that touch upon the same themes or use the same genre.I was pleasantly surprised at the wide range of genres and the quality of artistry included in this guide.  Indeed the range is so great that I was surprised that some of these comic books or graphic novels were appropriate for this age range.  For example the ""My Boyfriend is a Monster"" series seem more for 9+ grade than 6-8 to me but perhaps we are pushing our girls to think about dating at earlier and earlier ages.  Likewise ""Bone"" was a shocker to see in these pages since we've always considered this a high school or adult graphic novel around my house.Regardless Robins and Wildsmith give us enough information to make an informed decision before we buy any of these for our children or children we know.

11839,11840,"I found this headlight to be a very useful product.  I had no problems with the brightness of the lamp or its longevity.  It has a red light (actually two LED bulbs), two white light intensity settings, and a flashing bright white light setting.  It is quite bright, more than bright enough, even on the lower brightness setting, for use illuminating a local area when I am doing some home repair.  It also comes with a flashing green following light (a small green LED located at the back of the battery pack) that someone can use to follow someone wearing the headlamp.Pros -· The lamp can be adjusted to give a direct ahead beam or a beam that is tilted down to light the ground immediately ahead or when using it for repair work to direct the beam to the correct location.· The unit comes with lithium batteries.· The red light is useful for dark adaptation and for hunting animals that are not sensitive to red light.· The lower intensity white light increases the battery life.  The flashing bright light setting also increases the battery life, while still giving the maximum brightness.· The unit has a flashing green following light, located on the battery pack, which is useful when the light is used with a group of people walking on a trail.Cons -· The battery pack is located at the back of the headband and is very bulky.  This prevented wearing the unit under a hardhat and I could not use it on top of my hardhat as it slipped off.· Since I do not use the headlight for leading people along a trail, I found the following light to be a battery waster.  Unfortunately there is no switch to turn this feature off.  The manufacturer states that the following lamp draws very little power, but even a little is too much when the lamp is sitting unused in my workshop for months at a time. I had to open the battery pack and remove a battery to break the circuit in order to turn it off when the lamp was not in use.When I replaced the battery the following light was turned off.  There is, however, no way to turn off the following light when the headlamp is in use.All in all, this is the headlamp that I use around the house when I need a local ""hands free"" light.  When I finish using the headlamp I have to use the approach described above to turn off the following lamp, which I find to be not only annoying, but I am afraid that constantly having to open and close the battery pack will lead to an eventual failure of the closure clasp.

11843,11844,"Airplane! is not just A comedy movie, but one of THE comedy movies -- movies like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""And honestly, it deserves to be in that august company. This is one of the funniest movies ever, with a constant barrage of gags, running jokes, spoofs and parodies of various movies (""Saturday Night Fever,"" to name one) -- it never stoops to pretending to have any dramatic weight, but simply buries you in hilarity. Surely you'll enjoy this!Desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty) , former pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) follows her on an outgoing plane. It's actually his postwar trauma about planes that has led to their breakup, and now he boards the plane -- along with nuns, Hare Krishnas, an ill child, jive guys, and many others -- to prove his love for her.But as he tells stories of his romance to increasingly suicidal passengers, a REAL crisis arises: food poisoning! All the fish on the flight have gone bad, causing most of the passengers and the whole flight crew to become horribly ill. Only Ted has the chance to land the plane safely, with the guidance of the increasingly erratic people on the ground, and the advice of a kindly but not too helpful doctor (Leslie Nielson).""Airplane!"" bombards you with jokes -- crude jokes (boobs!), pop culture references (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), word puns (""... and don't call me Shirley""), parodies of other movies, characters being overly literal, random gags (Captain Oveur suffering the food poisoning symptoms) and running gags that they milk just long enough (""Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop..."").In other words, it's packed with so many jokes that it nearly explodes. And yet it flows naturally from one ridiculous gag to the next, like a vast patchwork quilt of hilarity where everything fits. Directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker never let the humor go slack;the one sentimental moment in the movie is handled as a parody (""Win one for the Zipper!"") and the mortal peril they're in is played for laughs.Example: when the flight crew gets sick, Elaine has to activate the autopilot... which is a big inflatable faux-pilot. When he later deflates, she has to blow him back up in a very suggestive way.And all the acting is spot-on -- everybody plays their roles with exaggerated seriousness, whether it's Hays' lethally boring tales of his life or Nielson providing ""uplifting"" encouragement at all the wrong times. Even the small roles are handled with deadly, hammy seriousness.Other highlights include Peter Graves as the not-so-secretly gay pilot (""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?""), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as Roger Murdock as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hagerty as the baby-voiced Elaine, and Robert Stack as the grizzled, macho yet insane Rex Kramer.A mere description of a plot and a few of the jokes can't sufficiently describe ""Airplane!"", one of the greatest comedy movies of all time. Insanely, uproariously funny.",

11849,11850,"When you need to staple a lot of pages together, a manual stapler just doesn't normally do a very good job. If you need to staple up to forty-five pages together often, or if you simply have a process that requires rapid and repetitive stapling, then you would benefit from a product like the Swingline Electric Stapler, Speed Pro 45 Sheets, Black (S7042141).This stapler has suction cups on the bottom that keep it steady while you work with it, but still remove easily from the surface when you wish to move the unit. An easy-to-access push button on the back of the stapler ejects the staple tray, where you simply set a new stick of staples in it, then push it back in place. This is easier to load than my manual stapler at work.Once you have the stapler loaded and plugged in, you are ready to go. Just slide the pages into the stapling platform and the stapler does the rest of the work.The device comes with two boxes of staples. The first is a box of 1000 standard Swingline staples that work for smaller staple jobs. The second box contains 500 high capacity staples that can handle 25-45 sheets. The links below are to purchase larger quantities of the staples that came with this device. Any standard staple would work, but you will want tto buy the high capacity staples if you have larger documents to staple.[[ASIN:B00T6JSXFK Swingline Staples, Speed Pro High Capacity, 3/8-Inch Leg Length, 210 per Strip, 5000 per Box (S7035465)]][[ASIN:B003WP3VUQ Swingline SF1 Standard Staples (5,000 per box)]]I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone who has a need for an electric stapler.",29.0
11850,11851,"Purchased almost a year ago, my wife and I have been very pleased with this trash can. Reading through some of the reviews, it seems some people have had issues with their sensor - I can only imagine the frustration, and I send them my sympathies...there's nothing worse than technology failing on you. I am happy to report however that our trash can has been working nicely.PROS- Attractive brushes finish- Automatic lid activation- Fills out trash bags very nicely- Bottom vents allow for easier bag removal- Button for keeping the lid open- Includes accessory to hold bag firmly at the top- Reasonably pricedCONS- Power adapter sold separately- Eats through batteries with daily use- Deodorizer feature is almost worthlessWe were a little disappointed by the fact that the trash can burns through batteries quickly enough to make the power adapter a necessary purchase - luckily I had one that matched the voltage/current required, dodging that bullet. Many have had to pay for it though, so it was worth mentioning. Following the advice of previous reviewers, we have kept the sensor clean to the point of obsession (a quick wipe every time we throw away a paper towel, and then some), however the sensor has worked nicely for us. It is particularly handy when your hands are full of potato peelings etc.The design of the trash can allows for bags to be filled to about 90% capacity, and with the ""vents"" at the bottom, bags are more easily removed than with other cans we have used. The plastic rim holder thing that comes with the trash can is very helpful, and does a great job at keeping the bag over the lip.As I mentioned, others seem to be having problems with their sensors, but I have to honestly report no issues on our end. Because of this, I can definitely recommend this trash can - it's nice not having to leave the trash can open while working in the kitchen, with the added bonus of less serious cleaning due to the fact that no one is touching the trash can with ""kitchen hands"".

Last year I bought some listed as conforming but it turns out that it measures 2 inches over the limit before using the expander zippers if one includes the wheels and handles as airlines specify.  That is why I went out with a tap measure.  I found most 28 to 29 inch bags do not conform despite advertised measurements.  This one was no exception.  I found a black one of the same variety to measure, and unless they make an even larger size, this is the same bag.  The mid-size bag comes in just a few inches under the limit but this one goes over.  They did not have the carry on size in the store to measure.I figured I could take the $100 risk that the airline does measure my bags, going each direction, or spend the same money on new bags now and use them multiple times.

11876,11877,"My husband loves home-made pies, so I thought it would be fun to make mini-pies from time to time, just to change things up a little.  After reading the Amazon reviews for various competing mini-pie makers, I ordered this well-reviewed SUNBEAM 4-PIECE PIE MAKER.  Little did I know what it had in store for me!I followed the booklet's recipe for blueberry mini-pies to the letter.  I lightly oiled the pie cups, preheated the pie maker, used the provided tool to cut top and bottom crusts from Pillsbury ready-made crusts, prepared the filling, used the provided tool to press the bottom crusts into the pie maker, measured 1/2 cup of filling into each bottom crust, added the top crusts, and clamped the top of the pie maker shut.The pie maker began emitting steam, which seemed odd.  After 10 minutes, the pie crusts were done.  However, the pie filling had boiled out onto the pie-maker plates, and a lot of it had spilled down the outside and into the hinges.  Because the pie-maker plates were hot, the filling was busily burning onto the plates.  As I was removing the mini-pies, the bottom of one burst and dropped all its filling.  The final straw was my husband's comment that his intact mini-pie seemed ""kind of filled with air""!Oh well.  Maybe I should have used one of the booklet's two recipes for pie crusts--although the booklet did say you could use ready-made crusts from the grocery store.  Or maybe I should have crimped the top and bottom crusts together--although the instructions did not say to do this, and the plates look like they will do the crimping when you close the lid.The cleanup was such a nightmare, I have no desire to ever use this appliance again.  The mini-pies are cute, but the preparation time is about the same as for a full-sized, double-crust blueberry pie (except that a 9"" pie needs 45 minutes to bake).  Also, the mini-pies don't hold much filling, especially if you have to use less than 1/2 cup of filling.  I rate this Sunbeam 4-piece pie maker at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the official Amazon scale).",44.0

11884,11885,"This is an excellent device that seems to have all its bases covered.  For bathroom use, you can set humidistat and sensitivity, to fine tune how quickly your fan comes on during a shower and how long it stays off afterward.  These dials may also need to be adjusted depending on bathroom size.  You can also press the button to turn the fan on manually.  This then activates the adjustable timer (10-45min) countdown.  This manual mode is overridden when the sensor picks up humidity.  So, you could turn the fan on before you get in the shower, and then it will shutdown automatically afterward when the excess humidity is gone.They say that once you open the door to the bathroom, the sensor reacts differently.  As I like to leave the bathroom door open after a shower, I do wish there was a minimum run time you can set that would only count down after the humidity level returns to normal, to make sure you ran the fan long enough.  You can sort of do the same thing with the dials mentioned previously, but I think this way would be more surefire.If you don't have proper attic ventilation, and therefore have a fan in your attic window or through your roof, this device can be set up to cycle hourly in 10-45 min. increments as desired.  This could help you save on your electricity bill if your fan is providing more ventilation than necessary when run 100% of the time.  Ideally, you'd probably change your cycle time with the seasons.The device works very well.  As another reviewer warned, you do need full wiring to use this product, so check that out before taking on a retrofit installation.  Besides that, it offers a lot of different settings to allow this to be controlled in almost any way you like.  It's certainly the best type of fan control that I've seen available, and especially good if you have kids (or other people in the house) that don't like to run the fan with a shower for whatever reason; this can be set to force its use.

11895,11896,"This is a tough one.  Coming away from this book, I can say that I love Shari Goldhagen's sense of the fragility of relationships and her empathy for often profoundly unsympathetic characters.  This is an author who lives for the cognitive dissonance experienced by all of us as we drift away from and sometimes back towards the people we see ourselves as truly being.  She has an exceptional ear for dialogue, which is probably at the top of my wish list for any writer.    I also feel like this novel must have been rushed to press or simply given up on at some point mid-rewrite.  There are contrivances that reek of coincidence, a science fiction conceit that might have actually paid off more satisfyingly had the author really taken a left turn very literally into another universe or two, and an already much-commented-on bit of weirdness where one character is addressed in the second person for reasons that remain entirely opaque.  If I'm just being dense about this last part, I'm clearly in good company.    And then there's the sex.  It's neither salacious nor gratuitous, but somehow jarring, particularly as concerns the character of Phoebe, who for awhile seems to be well on her way to being a fading-starlet-wannabee-turned-call-girl. There is a payoff of a sort with the setup, but with so many YA (""Young Adult"" genre) elements to this story, it feels somehow out of place, as does another character's very inappropriate youthful tryst with a stepparent. (One that could only have been characterized as abusive had the genders there been switched.)    A further bit of weirdness here is personal to me.  I chose this book for the blurb, which mentioned Orlando, FL, I believe, as well as Chicago (turns out to be more Skokie/Evanston), Los Angeles and Cincinatti.  I'm very familiar with three of these cities and have a passing acquaintance with the fourth.  I was once a teenage sci fi geek.  I realize the mention here is something of a non-sequitor, but I found the author's sense of place to be utterly convincing, and am in a reasonably unique position to know.    ""In Some Other World..."" reflects an eclectic heritage, and a sufficiently schlocky press release might make comparisons to ""The Breakfast Club"", ""The Big Chill"", heck, maybe even ""Galaxy Quest"".  Anyway, the apparent cinematic influences are enough to keep things interesting, so while I was a bit disappointed this time, I'd gladly give this author's work another spin.",52.0

When charged for 8 hours, the Hallomall 200 lumen LEDs can put out a circular beam of soft white light that effectively illuminates an area 10 to 15 feet away at approximately 120 degrees circular and it automatically turned on and stayed lit for the entire May night from 8 PM to 5:30 AM, then turned off automatically. When in place, the solar cell and light can be raised or lowered independently of each other at about 45 degrees each. Easy to assemble, easy to install, economical price, solar powered. Highly Recommended. Five BRIGHT Stars. (2 pack of Hallomall Bright Outdoor LED Solar Spotlight, ground stake, installation screws, and instructions. One item was provided for testing and an impartial review.)",43.0

11898,11899,"Our extended family is full of dogs of all shapes and sizes, from Aiko, the Chihuahua mix to Kato, the Rhodesian RIdgeback, with stops in between for Bostons, Dachshunds, Maltese, Belgian Malinois and Tervuren, and All Americans. What they have in common is that they LOVE these treats! Crazy love. The tails sweeping the ground, quivering with excitement kind of love. The treats get a 5 star PLUS rating.However, the container is just kinda silly. The idea is that you place a treat on the pig's nose and push it in, it will fling it off into the room for the dog to catch. In our experience, it almost never worked. The nose would push in, but then not pop out. Or it would only push in part way, an then not pop at all. Just a gimmick that doesn't work.",27.0
11899,11900,"Visiting our local nursery we explained our problem of getting anything to grow in our raised garden bed. The bed is just under the canopy of a mesquite tree growing in our neighbor’s yard. The small leaves of the mesquite are acidic. The tree and the oleander bushes outlining the neighbor’s yard make gardening a challenge.The botonist’s recommended adding a humic acid solution to the soil. He showed me a $26 for a diluted liter with other ingredients. I held my breath, waited to get home and checked Amazon.I found this 2lb Terra Vita SP-90 and the reviews hinted a mixture with Azomite. I made a 1:1 mixture in a jar of Humic Acid and Azomite. I put about 2 teaspoons in a 2-gallon watering can and watered my roses, figs, pomogrante, lavender, peppers, tomatoes, chard, peas, artichokes, romenesco brocholi, and everything else in sight. Then I forgot about it. About a week later I noticed that I had a lot of leaves on the fig trees. A lot, like about 5x as many leaves from the week before; and I’m seeing fig buds. Everything else started picking up too. Now it’s spring and I expect that plants will start perking up and growing. I realized that I had not started watering the Plumaria because it hadn’t started leaving and I thought it was dying. So I watered it with the solution 2 days ago. It is leafing too. I’m more than pleased. It all may be a coincidence but I am going to continue monthly treatments of this solution and we’ll see what happens.The patch under the mesquite continues to be a problem but I’m seeing signs of first growth. Not a lot, but some. I’m hopeful.I am sharing my mixture with neighbors. They are as excited as I. I am crossing my fingers. Both the TeraVita SP-90 Humic Acid and the Azomite are rated pure and good quality. I agree.",73.0

11909,11910,"I have to laugh at some of these reviews panning the movie's lack of 3D? Did they not read the product description before purchasing? I guess not, so if anyone is interested let me state right up front: This Movie Is Not In 3-D.I was not looking for 3D, and would've been irritated if I would've have to wear a pair of those red/blue 3D glasses to watch this movie. In general I find 3D annoying even with today's films, and if there is a 2D option available, I'll usually try to view films in that format. ""Amityville 3-D"" was one of a bunch of 80's flicks that tried to cash in on a resurgence of the 3-D craze; ""Friday the 13th III"", ""Parasite"", ""Comin' at Ya!"", ""Jaws III"" and a few others made a half hearted attempt, but it just failed to catch on. (....of the bunch, the only film worth your while in that group is ""Friday the 13th III"").I really liked the premise of ""Amityville 3D"", with Tony Roberts plays a reporter, Jack Baxter, who works for a magazine, traveling around and debunking phony psychics and disproving the supernatural. He's not only a skeptic, but actively disbelieves. He is in the middle of a nasty divorce, but still wants to maintain a relationship with his teenage daughter, (and look for Meg Ryan in an early role as one of the teen's friends).Baxter purchases the Amityville house so that he can move out of his cramped apartment, and begin working on writing a book.When bizarre stuff begins happening around his house, his former assistant claims the house is truly haunted, and that there is some bad juju centered around an old well found down in the basement.This movie is a bit of a slog to get through. It's not horrible, but it is very slow. There are a few laughs found here and there, the unintentional kind, and there is a cool idea buried here, but the movie just flounders, with the ""action"" coming in the last 10 minutes or so. Only recommended to fanswho want to watch the whole series, otherwise stick with the first two films.",36.0

11911,11912,"I do not often give a video game five stars, but this one earned it.  Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare on the PS4 is an excellent game.  You will enjoy it, as long as you know what you are buying.  The first thing you need to know, is that this is a multi-player game.  This is not a game with multi-player.  ALL MODES are essentially multi-player.    The two main sections are a co-op, base defense game that is very similar to the Mass Effect 3 multi-player.  The other section is a straight up vs. mode.    Normally I hate competitive vs. multi-player.  This game is different.  They do an excellent job keeping the playing field level.  It's difficult for one or two players to brutalize the other players, as is so common in many multi-player modes.    They did an excellent job mixing up characters.  They are diverse and enjoyable.  They are so well balanced that I do not have a favorite class yet.    This is a third person shooter which sounds violent.  However, they do it in a manner that is not gory.  This game is safe for kids and fun for adults.    PROS:    Approachable for people who have never played multi-player games.    Great graphics even if they are cartoonish.    Clean and responsive game play.    Great mix of classes.    Great character animations.    Not as violent as most multi-player games.    CONS:    No story mode.    Lacks a real solo mode.    100% reliant on centralized servers.      One final comment - like ALL PS4 multi-player games, this game requires a subscription to Play Station Plus.  If you do not have a PSP account or do not want to pay for it, buy the PS3 version.  That version is also ten dollars cheaper.",91.0
11912,11913,"I bought this for a beardy who had a damgaed sinus cavity from being bit by a litter mate when she was tiny.  She gets a yellow drip from her eye and nose which causes a raw spot on her lip and bacteria problems on the skin of the whole side of her face and beard. She also has thick dead skin that just won't shed independently without this medicated skin thereapy. She HATES the taste of it (as did the pet in the previous review), which causes her to not be cooperative for the treatments. You HAVE to keep up with the treatments daily until the condition clears; if you don't follow the directions it obviously won't work. Be liberal with the coverage or dosing, and DO keep the animals away from water and sand or walnut bedding as it will stick to the syrup like treatment or wash off. It does not affect breeding animals as she had two clutches totalling 53 eggs during daily dreatments. Her's is a lifelong problem.If it wasn't for this medication, I know a specialty veterinarian would have charged me $$$ to get my beardy Huevos back to health. Give this product a try for the recommended symptoms in the description - it is worth the money. It has a tip that is a drop dispenser making applications on small spots easy. Watch that your pet doesn't clamp down on the tip for mouth treatments because they can remove the hard dropper end and get it their mouth along with a glob of medine. Huevos did this, and she did not get sick...just surprised that she made her situation worse.Hope this review helps some sick pets get well.",30.0
11913,11914,"The interesting thing is that I just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy so reading this so quickly afterwards really showcased how superficial the 50 Shades series was and how deep this lovely novel is. 50 Shades is like commercial candy and this book is like a finely made Swiss chocolate.I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this. It began somewhat depressing, a woman feeling trapped in the routine and exhaustion of her married life with kids. Haven't we all felt somewhat downtrodden when our kids are young and we lose our way in cleaning up, feeding, and answering questions?But then it backtracks to her life in the Australian bush and as she begins to grow and blossom into puberty and feeling the power of her own sexuality she reaches out to others to test the power of her new found growth. Naivety puts her in some awkward situations (and as a parent, I found them rather scary) but she is also longing for the returned love of a man as her father has seemingly removed himself from showing signs of love and affection.And then she discovered an old house, seemingly abandoned, that becomes the setting for the biggest change in her life. A time of exploration, blossoming, lessons, love, reflection, growth, turmoil, soul searching and also what often holds her back from living the rest of her life with freedom and abandon.The fact that this is mostly about the relationship (and sexual growth and experimentation) between a young man and a teenage girl is certainly controversial but I don't think it was written to be a political stand on sex with a minor. We never really know her age but since she still has to go back to school at the end of her summer I assumed she was 16 or 17.The writing style is very different than a traditional chapter by chapter story unfolding since we always hear from the first person is snippets of short chapters with very little fill in.What was amazing was how wellit conveys the struggle a woman can go through with sexuality, the power behind it, and the deep emotional feelings that accompany that aspect of a woman. I was really pleased with where the story ended. Just right.It may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking.",30.0

This is a great system and the system will either stack or it can be turned to nest on the one beneath it... which comes in handy if you have some trays that aren't full you can get a few more in the bucket. I read some reviews on these and don't quite get what the complaints are about. I get my 5 gallon buckets from emptying paint or spackle and there's no way I can get enough items into these trays to come anywhere near the weight when these buckets were full of what originally came in it. I have lots of screws & nails but I'd guess that only about 2/3 of the space in each tray is useable because of the way they're built so I'd say my heaviest bucket maxes out at about 30 pounds. I have about 20 of these trays and another 10 of another kind [[ASIN:B00023S8JU Custom LeatherCraft 1152 2?-Inch High, Full-Round Bucket Tray]] so I can have a dedicated bucket for nails, screws, plumbing parts, electrical parts and one for my drip-line watering system parts. If money is no object then I don't think you can do much better than this brand. That said, I'm buying LeatherCraft for about 4 bucks a tray, including shipping, because I'm cheap and it's a decent line though the handles are inferior to the ones on the Bucket Boss. This is, in my opinion, 5-stars all the way.

The Bluetooth range isn't stellar, but I found that keeping the app running on an iPad Mini on a kickstand connected to some external speakers for the temperature alarm is the ultimate in lazy cooking. A lot of the challenge is lost, but it really frees up time for doing other things where stopping every half hour or so for a temp check would be inconvenient.Yeah, that's right... I want to go change my oil while I'm smoking a large piece of bacon-wrapped beef. In the winter. In the snow. Uphill. Both ways. Not that I have anything to prove to anybody. *cough*Really, the only downside to the iGrill2 is that I usually take a beer with me when I go to ""check on the meat"". So, it's kind of put a dent in my dedicated drinking time.",40.0

11955,11956,"I’ve been a fan of Child’s novels with Douglas Preston for a number of years now. And as such, I also continue to follow their independent books like this one as well, though I must admit that I never enjoy these solo works as much as the books that they work on together - they always seem to lack something...In Child’s latest enigmalogist hero, Dr. Jeremy Logan, who has appeared in some of Child’s earlier books, though there isn’t really enough of an overlap to necessitate reading these in order, first addresses a crowd guaranteeing there isn’t a Nessie after all. And moments later, the book makes me wish that it had opened a few weeks earlier when Logan reveals that there is a Loch Ness monster after all... Instead, Logan returns to his roots to investigate the odd suicide of a researched at a private institute called the Lux that Logan himself had been asked to leave years earlier.With short chapters and methodical clues, this is a fast read that is also entertaining. Cliffhangers keep the pages turning, though it does take some time for the reader to feel like much genuine progress has been made. And surprisingly, this is a more straightforward thriller than some of Logan’s earlier appearances. And there isn’t any off-the-rails stuff either, which keeps this even more exciting and fast-paced as the plot picks up. Child nicely maintains the tension throughout which makes this one of the strongest yet of Child’s solo novels!",22.0

11967,11968,"I purchased this Pro Diver locally as a gift for a girlfriend who like me is tall and a bit ""big boned"". The Diver Pro is larger than the average women's watch, but that's good for women who are tall with larger frames. The person I'm getting this for is over 6ft tall and her wrist is proportionally larger than a more average sized woman.  I purchased two similar Invicta watch models for myself. The closest of the two I bought is the [[ASIN:B00FALPY0A Invicta Women's 15134SYB Pro Diver Silver]] which has a slightly narrower and black ring on the bezel and is a little less expensive. The other I got is the [[ASIN:B00FALPXMY Invicta Women's 15136SYB Pro Diver Blue]]. These are a bit different and also very nice within the same theme. I'm very pleased with both of these.  This is a very good looking watch with an athletic feel. My aging eyes can read the time easily in the morning without glasses. That is, on my similar model with the same size face. That wasn't so true for my [[ASIN:B00068TIGI Seiko watch]] modeled after a lady Rolex Jubilee which has a much smaller face. I bought it last century and it remains a very nice watch with an elegant look.  The silver face and diver's bezel make a striking fashion statement and I feel it is a very attractive look. The band is comfortable and perfectly fits the design of the watch. It looks good on my wrist and I am sure it will work well for my girlfriend when she gets it at Christmas.  This watch is certainly oversize for the wrist of a petite or smaller boned woman, though that can sometimes be a striking fashion statement as well. It appears solidly made like it will hold up well for the active woman banging it around out in the world.  On the two I got for myself and having examined this one I'm totally pleased with both the function and fashion in the Invicta Pro Diver watches.  I have not gone swimming with my Pro Diver watches and I doubt I'll ever take more than 12ft under water, so waterproof isn't the least concern for me. I'm confident it's great in that area but I'll probably never test that aspect of the watch.  Petite women or with slender wrists should be aware it's somewhat over-sized and it is a bit heavier than smaller and less rugged watches.  Hope this helps someone with their buying decision.",77.0

12008,12009,I bought these 2 pet litter mats to tuck under the front of 2 litter boxes so they would catch most of the litter being tracked out of the boxes.They do what I wanted them do. I can pick them up and shake them out over the litter box and tuck them back under. Very easy. I was concerned the cats would not step on them but that has not been an issue. I figured they could hop into the litter boxes from the side if they did not like them but they seem to have no issues stepping on them. Very pleased.,19.0
12009,12010,"The company makes excellent kites and this is another great product.  People do need to realize this is NOT your traditional kite that you toss in the air and it soars up and up on its own with you just sitting there motionless.  No, this is a ""glider"" meaning you have to constantly move with the kite to keep it afloat.  It does float very nicely and effortlessly in little to no wind at all, but even with a gentle breez you have to keep moving with the kite to keep it lifted.  What results is a very graceful (almost zen like) interaction with the kite.  It takes a few minutes of practive but you should quickly grasp the concept here.  There are great videos online that demonstrate how this all comes together.",25.0

12013,12014,"The Doctor and Leela arrive on a planet about to be hit by a missile and try to get the inhabitants off. However, they find the inhabitants are genetically altered humans on a mysterious scientific project and they're on a planet where killer plants grow in the darkness and kill.The plot here is very suspenseful as we don't quite know the full extent of what's going on. While the basics remain the same, the story has layers that are peeled off as the story continues to unfold until we at last learn the shocking truth.After the last episode ended with an argument between the Doctor and Leela, this story quickly diffuses the situation in a way that felt a little bit too easy. Still, as Leela says, the Doctor had gone days without talking to her which had led her to read more and what she'd read were fairy tales. Leela's pointing out similaritites to Fairy Tale moments. This device works very well throughout the story, creating a little bit of a sense of rythym, being used for occasional comic relief, and in one case actually adding to the terror of the moment (when Leela's reminded of Little Red Riding Hood meeting the wolf disguised as her grandma.It's a wonderfully atmospheric and clever tale featuring great acting and a superb soundscape.",15.0

The taste wasn't as chocolatey as some of the other cereals on the market, but I would happily trade the lack of flavor for the lack of reduced processed sugars, etc. I just wish it had tasted a little better so the kids would have eaten it.

12019,12020,"I purchased a can of this locally on a whim with low expectations since it was in a can. Frankly, I was delightfully surprised by how flavorful it is.To the folks whose reviews claim that this is mis-labeled hummus instead of baba ghanouj - I disagree. Perhaps the confusion comes from the denser consistency of this product. If you follow the directions by adding some olive oil and lemon and thoroughly mixing it in, then the consistency will be that of a well made baba ghanouj. The directions also call for mixing in crushed garlic, which is essential to achieve an authentic flavor. I believe those ingredients were left out of the can and left to the buyer to increase shelf life.After mixing in the lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic I also add a pinch of cumin into the mix. Right before serving I will sometimes sprinkle cumin or summac over the top for an added flavor as well as drizzle more olive oil over the top of the baba ghanouj in the serving dish or bowl.There are a few nutritional facts you should take into account: there are about ten servings in a can, and each one contains 180mg of sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet you need to be careful of how much you consume. Also each serving contains 2.5 grams of fat of which a half gram is saturated. This is BEFORE you add olive oil, which will raise the fat content per serving by another 14 grams of fat per tablespoon of oil used when you mix the baba ghanouj. Each of the ten servings is 40 calories before adding in the olive oil, which contains an additional 140 calories per tablespoon.While the above nutritional facts look dismal, bear in mind that they are about par for any properly prepared baba ghanouj - although you can control the sodium content by making this dish from scratch. Although my diet is restrictive I can break the rules occasionally when I want baba ghanouj but am too lazy to make it myself. Used in moderation this is an excellent alternative and one that is authentic if you follow the directions and mix in the missing ingredients and garnish to taste. And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one.",40.0

The instructions are quite complex, the controls hard to manage as it takes many minutes to understand what they are for.  I found it the least user friendly Xbox game I have owned.  It was almost a relief when I finally gave up trying to play through the freezes by restarting new games.  Even using your weapons to shoot an enemy was unusually difficult for us as you didn't know what that particular weapon's capabilities were without reading long instructions.If you are into games with minutes and minutes of scenes and dialogue before you ever get to play, and you are experienced or patient enough to learn the intricacies, then this might be a super game.

12021,12022,"Sure you can get a chalkboard, create an entire chalkboard wall with chalkboard spray paint from Home Depot, spray the inside of your pantry to make a chalkboard...but the real fun may come in using these in gourmet and creative ways.I like to get slabs of slate or a similar stone with some grit at a garden or Hardware store, wash, and layout gourmet foods and appetizers when I entertain and use the chalk markers on them to identify each item.  These actually make a table look beautiful, especially if you can find ones that are not square cut (although those work great too).  This also makes a great hostess gift to skip the usual bottle of wine you bring as a gift, lay some cheeses out on a slate, and give them the pack of chalk markers.  People go wild over that one.Chalk is messy and dusty and unpleasant in so many ways--including breathing it.  Not so here.  No big nibs, no dust, no mess, no rubbing off--what you do is prime the marker by pressing the tip down until the chalk ""ink"" flows through.  Then start writing!When it's time to wipe off? A damp rag takes it all off--but it  does not rub off like regular chalk otherwise.It is far more easy to write with this.  And make it look good when you do it!It's nice to have lots of colors and be able to label the different names of cheeses etc. in different colors, or give each kid a color if you want to keep a wall planner calendar and label events for each person, another color for family events, another color for to do list etc.Great for kids to draw on because you can give them chalkboards, they can get colorful, wipe off and start again.Great to take a long board, spray paint it with chalkboard spray, have everyone write notes about what they love about a birthday person and have it run down the center of a table for a birthday party--nice for the photos and memories and for everyone to get to do and read.

12022,12023,"I've got a lot of laptop cases, backpacks, and messenger bags that I've gone through looking for something ideal for various situations.  I liked the looks of this one, so thought I'd give it a try.I'm in the IT field, so I carry a lot of things around - external USB drives, thumb drives, power cord, external Blu ray / DVD drive, adapters, portable firewalls and wireless units, just a bunch of things.  So I'm more picky than most about bags.The colors on this are really great.  I love the way it looks, vibrant and bright with the greens, and the deep blue looks good as well.  There is padding not just on the straps, but on the back panel as well to protect your back and a laptop.  Unlike some that I've had, this one actually has a little bit of padding on the bottom of the laptop's sleeve as well.  That's a pet peeve of mine in laptop backpacks - when they don't have padding *where you set them down* all the time.I like the handle on top - some others I have just have smaller nylon straps as quick grab handles.  This one isn't very thick, but it works well.The downside for me is that there just aren't as many storage spots in here as I'd like.  Just the laptop sleeve in the rear most opening.  No pockets at all in the middle compartment.  And just two pockets, one zipper opening, and the tablet spot in the front opening.  Then there is the small zippered pouch on the top.  That's it.  Other than that one zipper comparement, the only thing that secures anything is the velcro strap for the laptop compartment.So for my use, it's too limited.  But for a student or someone with simpler needs, it really is a nice backpack.  It's comfortable, and those open spaces are great for books, change of clothes, or other things like that.  And I like that it has water bottle spots on both sides, since I like to carry some bottles of Lipton Iced Tea, and two is always better than one.The one odd thing missing isa small opening to feed earbuds or something through, so if you're a person who wants that, you'll need to settle for snaking the cord out through an opening in the zipper instead.Good backpack for the price.",53.0

Tart and sweet at the same time, it was a huge success, and a staple of the company. Later, the company spread out, making several other flavors of the candy, including Cherryheads (which were originally known as Cherry Chans and then Cherry Clans).Cherryheads are delicious, little red candies that are sweet and tart, and have that great cherry taste. Admittedly they are not as sour as the newer super-sour candies, but too many of those other candies just give you a wave of tasteless super-sour, and then you get to eat the super-sweet candy. With Cherryheads, you get a nice flavor of tart cherries, especially if you chew on them (which I recommend :-).When I was growing up in the Chicagoland area, Ferrara Pan candies were a staple of every kids diet. Now, eating Cherryheads takes me back to my childhood. Buy Cherryheads and enjoy a great candy. I highly recommend them!",39.0

12028,12029,"If you already got the first set to this entertaining and addictive series then the second half is a must, as we see the confrontation build up between self made enemies and greedy conglomerates.  What amazed me was how much I grew to enjoy the series as I watched it more and more throughout the series story, it gives a nice abundance of action,comedy,drama,heartache,tragedy and a touch of romance.  Also the array of endearing cast of characters also made the series very enjoyable throughout the show, as you come to care for some and dislike others which in itself is what makes a great series when you endear yourself to the characters and villains alike.  The animation felt a little reminiscent of a couple of other series Last Exile and Eureka Seven so if you've seen either one you might sense a case of deja vu when you watch the series,also the voice cast did a terrific job in their character roles both for the dubbed and subbed.  The extras aren't much at most just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs,  if you already got the first set then you've seen that the case box is just hardened cardboard to fit the two part series dvd cases into which while looking nice isn't anything really special except to a hardcore anime collector fan.

12031,12032,"I shoot classical guitar videos for my YouTube channel and use softboxes for diffusion. Diffusion materials absorb a lot of photons so a bright light is essential. FancierStudio claims their 60 watt CFL is as bright as a 300 watt incandescent light bulb, so I bought four and took the FancierStudio 60 Watt CFL for a test run in my studio.  This is a large CFL but fits fine in a small 16"" x 16"" softbox, e.g., the [[ASIN:B00OTG6474 Neewer 16x16"" Wired Softbox]] I use as a hair light or fill light (I use 105W CFLs for key). Probably not a good choice for household use as it’s too large for most fixtures. After a few minutes of warmup, it's blazing bright and has excellent color clarity. It's rated at 5500K and, indeed, is close to daylight temperature but leans to the cool side with a mild green tint. Not that can’t be handled by a minor WB tweak. For still images, I have to compensate for the green spike by pulling the tint slider to the magenta side.  I expected an 60 watt CFL to run hot but, strangely enough, runs cooler than the small CFLs I use around the house. The larger size is more efficient at dissipating heat than compact CFLs.  I own 60 watt CFLs from FancierStudio, KAEZI, ALZO, Neewer and others and they're all the same, right down to the green stripe and generic white box. I suspect they're all made in the same Chinese factory and are simply rebranded by vendors.  This is a great CFL: bright, cool running and reasonably true to color. I ordered a couple more to keep as backups.  4/18/2015 update: It's been about four months since I started using these CFLs and have shot hundreds of hours of video and stills using these CFLs and they've been 100% reliable.",47.0

We also tested an older, bare bones wind- up swing for comparison. The wind- up swing has no bells and whistles.No question about it. The Fisher Price Swing performed better and entertained the babies longer and even gave relief to a colicky baby.Other benefits and features:1.We found it very easy to put together, perhaps 25 minutes.2. Easy to fold and store. I know some find it takes up too much space but we have a designated closet for a grandchild, a mini walk- in closet and it easily holds the swing, a portable crib, and baby monitor.3. Definitely held the babies' attention. Calmed a colicky baby, as noted above.4. I had not been totally pleased with the wind-up swing because it always put our son to sleep, giving me temporary peace but disrupting his nap schedule.

I usually buy him 1-2 flashlights a year as gifts.  Kind of a running joke in our family that he knows he's either getting a flashlight or a pocket knife from me for a gift.He said this is one of the best flashlights he's ever owned.  In addition to him owning countless flashlights over the years, please also know he was a firefighter and used countless lights on the job as well.  This one gives off a blindingly concentrated beam, but still gives a nice lighter glowing outer ring to let you see things even if they aren't directly in the main beam.This flashlight will light up an entire room inside a house and can EASILY spotlight tree tops outside at 200 yards.  Highly recommended for camping, as an emergency light in your car, or any other use you may have.Two other benefits I've found to this light is that it's made of rubber, so your hand won't freeze in 3 seconds if you pick it up in the middle of winter if it's been in your car.  (Assuming you aren't wearing gloves).  Also, it's not round, so it won't go rolling off the counter or table if you set it down on it's side.  One downside about the rubber, is that it's not dog-chew proof as my dad learned.  His still works, but it has some teeth marks on the battery cap now.Ok, this review is long enough.  Bottom line, while I can rattle off 10 different lights and why you should own all of them, you can't go wrong with this one.  My dad and I both highly recommend it.

12063,12064,"In theory, a carrying case that holds and protects both your laptop and tablet sounds good on paper. Unfortunately, The Case Logic MLA-116 15.6-Inch Laptop and iPad® Attaché fails in both functionality and protection. The MLA-116 is a lightweight case that offers minimal protection to begin with. Protection to your iPad is almost non-existent if you plan on carrying it in the case with your laptop. The interior of the case has an iPad pocket for storage, with basically no protection from it being damaged from contact with the laptop. I won't even attempt to transport both my tablet and laptop together in the MLA-116. Storage is somewhat limited too. You have a pouch on the from which secures with Velcro, and an open pocket on the back of the case. If you want to use the MLA-116 as a lighweight laptop case, it will serve that purpose. But protection is minimal, and the current $45-$50 price tag is just too high for a nylon carrying case. The Case Logic MLA-116 Laptop and iPad® Attaché is described as being ""thickly padded"" with ""spacious storage"". I find this grossly exaggerated, and just not the case.

12064,12065,"I purchased the five set kabuki brush which I'm realizing now was a little overkill (how many kabuki brushes can you have?) but I was highly intrigued by the set and the companies dedication.    First impression. The packaging is great. The brushes come individually packaged and the brush holder all come in a box filled with pink confetti and a very cute sticker (that I won't spoil for you:), this would make a perfect gift for any makeup lover.  When I opened the bags for each brush they emitted and awful smell. Seriously they smelt awful which was an initial turn off. I immediately washed them my preferred way, with baby shampoo, and the smell was gone. I am still not fan of the idea that the brushes came loaded with chemicals but this is the only con.    The brushes are AMAZING. Incredibly dense and full yet incredibly soft and pick up makeup so well. These apply effortlessly and really give your skin an airbrushed look. So easy to use yet so effective. These brushes are far better than Sigma's kabuki though somewhat different, Sigma's have a slightly larger head and are fluffier however these are denser and equally as soft as Sigmas and I find the denseness gives a better application. I won't be using my Sigma again any time soon. These brushes also have a great weight to them. Very heavy duty wood handle with a sturdy metal ferrule, you can tell the quality just by holding them.    On top of this Beauty Junkees has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced. When I received the kit the leather tube was too small to hold all the brushes and I was very confused. I contacted the seller who responded right away and said they had made their brushes denser which in return caused them to be larger and they no longer all fit in the tube. She told me they were in the process of making a new larger tube and offered to send me one when they were completed in a few months. Well during this time the seller kept me up to date on the production of their tubes andsure enough I received one via priority mail wrapped in pink tissue paper. This tube is perfect for holding all the brushes and is a beautiful leather and very very solid. Beauty junkees truly cares about their customers satisfaction and was extremely kind and prompt in their response. I have since bought several of their other products because I value their great quality and great customer service.    Can't go wrong with this brush or this company.",81.0

12073,12074,"As a serious photo enthusiast, this [[ASIN:B004YG7JQO Storacell by Powerpax ""AA"" 12 Pack Battery Caddy]] fits my needs quite well. This one is black and holds twelve AA batteries, which is ideal for storage in my camera bag for backup in the field.This caddy dispenses AA batteries one at a time so that you're not fumbling when trying to load flash units or other devices, and it doesn't take but seconds to figure out that this can be all be done in a one-handed fashion.  I've loaded it with my [[ASIN:B004UG41XW Sanyo eneloop AA Ni-MHRechargeable Batteries]], and they fit perfectly. The black contrasts quite well with the white eneloop cells, making it easy to tell at a glance how many batteries you have with you.  Because of the unique Storacell design, I can insert fresh cells positive side up and exhausted cells positive down, so that they don't get mixed up.The Powerpax construction is quite robust, simple and highly functional.  The design is quite ingenious in that cells can be extracted singly and with one hand.  The material appears to be some form of sturdy polymer, and flip the battery holder over and you'll see they're a US-made product.What started this search for a better solution for battery storage was an incident during the winter, with snow on the ground.  It was cold and windy, and I was trying to get fresh AA batteries from a device quite similar in design to this [[ASIN:B003US4L4K AA battery storage box]].  I was shivering, and dropped the box, spilling all of the batteries in the snow, resulting in a dozen white eneloop Ni-MH cells falling into the snow.  I lost two of the batteries in the snow, and the one that I could retrieve were mixed up, fresh cells with exhausted.  Some considerable time was lost drying off the cells that I could locate, and even more time was lost testing them to see which were charged and which were exhausted.  After that I knew that there had to be a better solution, and this is just that.I've previously ordered the [[ASIN:B006IZKMYA Storacell by Powerpax Slim Line ""AA"" Battery Caddy, Clear]] that holds 4 AA batteries and the [[ASIN:B004YG7LEE Powerpax Slim Line ""AAA"" Battery Caddy, Yellow]], which holds 6 AAA batteries. Search around here and you'll find that these are available in a number of colors that should match your needs, and most of the popular battery sizes are covered as well.This is a highly recommend 5-star solution for anyone looking for storage of those loose batteries that we all have, and why I came back for more of these.8/29/2012",39.0

Since the entire thing is clear plastic, you really don't want to slice into it. I'd suggest a cardboard disc under whatever you wish to cut.Configuration 2: Simply remove the dome and flip over the base. Now you have a snack tray with bowl for dip. The bowl is removable so you can use your own.Configuration 3: Same as #2, but put the dome over it. Also the most compact storage option.Lots of uses, great for parties.

12082,12083,"I purchased to replace the dumb charger that came with cordless 24 volt lawn mower.  The charger that came with the mower did not shut its self off when the battery was fully charged, which means I had to time how long it was charging or cause damage to the battery. With the Schumacher the meter shows how much its charging (amps), and shows how it gradually reduces the charge as the battery reaches capacity, eventually shutting its self off.  No risk of over charging the battery.  The only negative is that the charger gets quite hot, even when it has charged the battery and essentially turns its self off.  For this reason I am hesitant to leave it connected to a battery long term, even thought it will not over charge the battery.  The 12 and 24 volt switch will also be handy for charging car batteries.

The top is heavier and slightly smaller than the bottom (the top is 13-15/16"" and the bottom exactly 14""). This configuration gives the hats a surprisingly responsive feel, and I like the sound - especially with the top hat loose in the clutch.Unlike the ride cymbals in the K. Custom Session series, which sound great out front, but terrible behind the kit, these hats are great sounding to both the drummer and audience. And they can project if needed, or will give subtle notes if played softly. This quality makes a pair perfect for just about any music genre or playing style.

12099,12100,"Despite my parents (or is that to spite them), I love pumpkin – pumpkin pie, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin muffins….  And thanks to my discovery this year, I can add Hershey's Kisses - Pumpkin Spice to the list.The orange and brown striped wrapper looks just like a normal kiss, and the shape is the same as well.  You’d certainly never know that these are something different – until you unwrap them.  Inside the foil, you’ll find an orange covered kiss.  If you bite into it, you’ll discover a small white chocolate core, but most of the candy is made up of the orangey outside layer.And that’s a good thing.  These kisses don’t take much like chocolate but then again white chocolate rarely does.  Instead, they taste just like perfectly spiced pumpkin, and the white chocolate adds a touch of sweetness while letting the pumpkin spice flavor take center stage.  I can pop one in my mouth and taste the delicious cookies or muffins I’ve had in the past.  They melt in your mouth fairly easily, although I find it hard to wait long enough for them to melt.  I’m chewing and swallowing while unwrapping the next one.Which isn’t necessarily a good thing since these kisses aren’t good for you.  9 of these guys have 210 calories, 110 of them from fat.  And there are no nutrients to speak of at all.  What did you expect from candy?This is hardly surprisingly when you take a look at the ingredients.

Films like Peter Jackson’s DEAD ALIVE or Eli Roth’s CABIN FEVER are some of my favorite splat-fests.  So when I saw the summary for CHEMICAL PEEL, I knew it was a must-see.  Chemical spills are always a great way to initiate some good gory action.  And let me tell you:  this film does not disappoint!  Chocked full of intensity and plenty of splatter, this horror flick is one you must see!I am very impressed with how much I enjoyed this film.  It is good on so many levels.  Great acting, intriguing premise, and excellent special effects (i.e. gore).  You just can’t ask for much more from a horror film.CHEMICAL PEEL starts off with a bang and it never lets up.  The tension is in the air from the get go, and it’s thick enough to feel on your skin.  I love this aspect of the film, as it puts the viewer in the midst of things right off.The acting is great, with a whole cast of unknowns (to me) giving top-notch performances.  I have to give particular note to Natalie Victoria, who portrays the main character, Rae.  Victoria does a stellar job as the role of the downtrodden heroine, and I hope to see more of her work in the future.  I also have to mention Arielle Brachfeld, who plays Rae’s sister, Angela.  Brachfeld does such a great job with her role, it’s almost scary.  She makes Angela into a Grade A bitch.  I can honestly say I have not wanted a character to die so badly in a long time.The special effects in CHEMICAL PEEL win the blue ribbon here, though.  There are several very nice gore scenes, and they don’t leave much to the imagination.  One of my favorites occurs when one of the girls decides to take a shower and wash off some of the muck in the air.  Little does she know that water is a trigger for the chemical reaction.  As a result, the girl melts (literally) in the tub.  This scene is very well done, and it will haunt my memory for a long time!CHEMICAL PEEL is a big win for me, and fans of horror as well as gore-hounds alike will enjoy this one.  Make sure you watch this on an empty stomach, though…even if you’re not very squeamish, some of these scenes will make you look away.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",87.0

12111,12112,"Keeping in mind my EDC folder is a Zero Tolerance 0300, the 4 star rating is based on the $18 and change I paid for this knife here on Amazon.  This knife is light, sharp, very comfortable in the hand, easy to find it if you drop it in the woods, has a nice sheath and as with all of the Bear Grylls products comes with the priorities of survival fold out. So for less than $20 you are getting a lot but for the $40 it cost at Cabellas I would leave it on the shelf. However for $18 if I lose or break it, no big loss. The knife is an excellent cutting tool but does not hold an edge extremely well due to the soft steel used in the BG knives (except for the Bear Grylls Ultimate Pro).  The soft steel does make re-sharpening a breeze though and this knife being half serrated there is always a usable cutting edge on this knife. There is a nice little pocketc inside the sheath for storing the Priorities of Survival fold out. The blade on this knife locks up very tight though I have not tested its strength nor will I. I don't put too much trust in the locks on my Benchmade, ZT's, SOG's, or Cold Steel knives. Locks can break and I can only assume the cheaper the knife is made the more prone it will be to break so I won't tempt my fate with this one by treating it like a fixed blade, I need all my fingers.  All in all it really is quite a nice sheath folder for fishing, day hiking, bug out bag or even a decent EDC knife for those on a tight budget.",31.0
12112,12113,"First off i got to actually play the game for 3 hours straight no problem. Which was the opening day.... for the past couple days i have unsuccessfully not connected to the servers. So i paid $80 for a demo. (i got the digital deluxe edition.) Of what i DID play its awesome....accept that you have to play with other players, NOT TRUE....you can make a private game. Or INVITE ONLY game. The problem with the online server is that only ONE of the dam areas that you can build your city works and you can only build your city on one plot of land. As far as game looks and gameplay, it's excellent. I liked how easy the menus were and its close to the other simcity gameplay. A lot of new things to go along with it too. I HATE that it does not have offline mode, i a member of the armed forces and what i do in my offtime is workout and game, and i love this game and i really dislike that i cannot play it while out to sea or deployed to places that don't have internet. (which is in May) As you all know the servers are not working...So what do you get when you have an Online game that runs on online servers that dont work? a game that doesn't work, and ultimately thats how this review is going to go for this. I paid $80 for 3 hours of working gameplay. Thank you EA and Maxim for delivering so far.. I will update and rate based on the game working....when it is actually working...but until then...1 star.",54.0

12114,12115,"I just had our plumber install this in our guest bathroom.  I wanted something high quality that would last for years.  With the exception of the plastic faux metal plate (escutcheon) it's a nice unit.  Here are my pro's and con's:Pro's:1,  Metal knobs move smoothly, feel solid and heavy, feel like quality.2.  I like the control at the top - straight up and down (pictured) is off, turn to left to turn on bath tub, turn to right to turn on water for shower.  Large control at bottom is for temperature and you can leave it set once you find a temperature you like.Con's:1.  The round stainless escutcheon is PLASTIC with a faux chrome plating, like a cheap shower head.  When I tap it vs. my Grohe escutcheon (gosh I hate spelling that word) which is metal, the plastic shower one feels very ""cheap"" while the one on the tub spout is nice and solid.  I'll report back how it holds up but likely for an infrequently used guest shower it will be fine.2.  No labeling - or graphics - to let users know what the controls do.  I'd like a symbol for shower and a symbol for tub at least on the top lever.Be sure you get the Grohe iBox sold separately  [[ASIN:B002VRJLLO Hansgrohe 01850181 3/4-Inch iBox with Service Stop]] to go with this.I saw the reviews that mentioned it was plastic but went ahead and ordered this unit thinking that it wouldn't make a huge difference.  I guess it does not -- but it feels ""cheap"" and as you can see from the price above, which doesn't include the ibox, this is NOT a cheap control.  At these prices the escutcheon should be metal.Hope this helps.",35.0

12132,12133,"Copland was actually a pretty decent film over all but nothing to write home about. One thing I found interesting is that the central character is played by Silvester Stallone who portrays a local sherrif who wanted to be a city cop but couldn't pass the entrance requirements because he suffered hearing loss in one ear when he was a younger man. You would think he wouldnt make an interesting choice to play this role when you consider other oscar caliber actors like Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Harvey Kietel play major roles in this film. But as it turns out Silvester was the perfect choice to play this character and he did pretty good playing this guy. Another aspect I enjoyed was noticing all the actors that were in this film that were regulars on HBOs hit series, The Sopranos. Eddie Falco, Robert Patrick, Frank Vincent, Annabella Sciorra, Arthur J. Nascarella and a few others played major characters on the series. No doubt the casting directors of the award wining HBO series must have used this film as a reference when decided on who would be cast in roles in that series. After all the mafia plays a role in this film about police corruption that begins simple enough then escalates out of control. Its a movie with a few embalances but it was pretty decent.",31.0
12133,12134,"The book is based on the interesting premise of naval exploration and combat in Indian Ocean in the aftermath of of the Second Anglo Dutch War. It is a time and place unfamiliar to most of us and rarely a fictional setting.Unfortunately, the writing just isn't up to the task. To call the plot meandering in an understatement. Too many characters are introduced. The characters are cardboard cut outs. The good guys are really good: loyal, virtuous, high minded. The bad guys are unalloyed bad. Smith initially creates a potentially interesting villain, the Earl of Cumbrae (think Harry Mudd from Star Trek), and a multi-dimensional character, the Dutch Colonel Cornelius Schreuder then proceeds to throw them away. Unfortunate, as both were more interesting than Courtney or any of his friends. The existence of an widespread naval order of chivalry is simply out of place at the time. And there are many small details simply wrong. For instance, one pound of black powder will propel about four pounds of lead shot. A musket ball of that era weighed in at a shade over an ounce so the single pound of powder would be good for about 64 rounds. The panic of Courtney's band of refugees when they find themselves reduced to about 50-lbs of powder is inexplicable.Too much time is spent on events that lead nowhere and the last part of the novel, the climax, is rushed through making it an afterthought that you just want to get through rather than the reason you read the novel.",37.0

12166,12167,"This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: ""The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.""In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.""Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it."" Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.""I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more.

I really appreciated the lights - nice touch.From what I've read about Weller, they are a very good company that produces high quality tools.

12204,12205,"The authors in Before Burnout deal with perfectionistic attitudes and behavior.  It is interesting that Minirth and Meier write so much about perfectionism and burnout, when they freely admit that they themselves are perfectionists or obsessive-compulsive.  This gives the books a personal touch, however, since they sprinkle personal examples throughout their writings.  They describe two kinds of perfectionists: the quality and the quantity characters.  Like their former volume, How to Beat Burnout, the biblical Martha gets the bad rap.  Unlike the former volume, this one contains no references to sources of information and studies cited.  Though this might make for easier reading, the academic might be frustrated, especially when he or she needs more convincing.  Sometimes it appears that the authors characterize just plain Christian spirituality, truth, and accuracy as obsessive-compulsive (OC) (p. 29).  Even Moses gets labeled an OC (p. 52).  They appear to assume that middle-class values, i.e. people who tend to work long hours, are really OCs (p. 61), and even characterize those with a high need for achievement as OCs (p. 68).  Their psychologizing of Calvin's theology (p. 71) reminds me of Erik Erikson's description of Lutheran theology as ""anal repulsive.""  (Luther was sitting on the pot when the doctrine of justification by faith broke through upon him.)  As in the preceding book, idealism, unrealistic expectations, bitterness and forgiveness are primary themes for recovery.  Yet some of their recommendations appear awkward.  They want their clients to choose friendships that will benefit themselves (p. 134), somewhat reversing Christ's command to love our enemies.  And the later chapters of their book appears only loosely tied to OC or perfectionistic behavior.",47.0

He is afraid of the unknown - so much so, that he wouldn't let me even approach him with another grooming tool.  When he hears the velcro, he sits down expecting to be petted.  He is typically afraid of my son but becomes VERY affectionate when my son is using this mitt.  Lots of head butting and licking.  This is pretty universally seen as approval from the cat.  He is welcome to leave any time, but stays for extended period of times when using the love glove.  EASY TO USE:  The use of this mitt is completely natural.  Put it on, and start petting your feline (or canine) friend.  Cleaning fur off of this mitt is very easy. I usually just peel the hair off, although it can be rinsed as well.  QUALITY: I have had this for over two years and it has not fallen apart or become damaged in any way.  CRITICISM:  Some say this doesn't do a good enough job of removing fur, and/or fills up too fast.  Maybe true.  But if it makes my cat happy, I guess that's all I need.

12250,12251,"I bought this belt because I liked the idea of a belt with no holes . It allows for a more finite adjustment for size. The belt is very well made with good quality leather and the buckle has a spring device with a release lever on the underside. Herein is where the problem lies. I tried the belt on and as expected I got a great fit, however, when I tried to release the belt,it would not. As hard as I tried,it I could not get it to release. I finally had to force the belt over my hips and step out of it to get it off. Inspecting the buckle, I could see no reason for the hang up so I tried adjusting the metal tab that locks in the adjustment and after several re-adjustments I got the belt to release reasonably well. On the plus side, this was one of a few no hole belts that you can order by size and not have to cut back to eliminate the excess leather. I ordered the recommended 2 sizes larger than my waist size and that worked perfectly. Perhaps my belt was defective, needing this re-adjustment but I guess I won't know because I decided against the hassle of a return.    On 2/27/15 I decided to amend my review. I raised it from 2 stars to 4 stars. Since I made my own adjustment to the buckle, the release mechanism is working just fine and the belt is holding up well.I did not give it 5 stars because of the adjustment I was forced to make.

My wife thought it would be bad or risky to buy online without trying a mattress first but it's for the kids and they obviously don't have a preference in beds and the reviews were good so we took a chance and it's great!It's also reversible so you can use either side that you wish.  It's a good deal with the prime shipping so I would definitely recommend this mattress.,14.0
12261,12262,"I grew up with classic chili - spicy, not too wet. A substance of its own. A stand-alone easy dinner treat.One winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking ""really, how different can chili recipes be?"" I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch.I was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times.",48.0

12300,12301,"I bought this stainless steel grate to use  with my 22 1/2 inch-diameter Masterbuilt kettle grill. The grate is 21 1/2 inches in diameter and is designed for use in 22 1/2 inch-diameter Weber kettle grills. The grate is manufactured out of sturdy, thick-gauge steel. The quality of the construction is evident; the grate is made in Taiwan. If you have owned cooking grates in the past that were made out of thin-gauged, flimsy steel which sagged under the weight of heavy foods such as brisket or large steaks, rest assured, sagging simply won't happen with this grate -- the thick-gauge steel bars and the circular insert in the middle of the grate allow for increased structural support as compared with the steel bars of flimsier grates.    The feature which increases the utility of this grate as compared with standard cooking grates are the  two hinged sections on the left and right sides of the grate, which allow the grate to flip upwards so that one can add additional charcoal or smoking chips/chunks, as needed. In addition, the center of the grate features a circular section approximately 12 inches in diameter, which is entirely removable, and, which can be removed to add charcoal and/or smoking woods, or, replaced with one of Weber's modular replacement sections, such as a griddle or a cast iron searing plate. Cleaning the grate is as easy as using hot water, dish soap and a steel wool scouring pad to scrape away fats and grease. The steel will acquire a patina over time from smoke and oil, but, that is to be expected, and, it doesn't affect performance in any way. This is a quality product which will last a long time.",25.0

A teenager Juliet does her usual stint as a Zombie killer,which hardly perpetuates into an engrossing and gripping game play.Most of your time is spent running in a straight line,with an occasional fork on the side,to battle hordes of Zombies,a la Dynasty Warrior fashion.The problem with this mechanic is that the game play becomes placid and prosaic just minutes into the game.Both the Enemy placement and AI is atrocious.These surfeit of enemies just wait to be dispatched via quick button mashing,and do not provide any feasible challenge.You can purchase moves and health with Coins collected from killing enemies.These moves hardly come handy,because most of your time is spent quickly getting rid of your opponents,by mashing the attack button.Adding to the misery is that after you press an attack button,you have to wait for the subsequent animation to finish.You cannot break animation by successively pressing attack buttons to change animation in the vein of BAYONETTA. Also Juliet faces the other way around if the enemies shift their positions.As a result your character cannot turn quickly to retaliate.The Level design is also underwhelming where you are mostly running in a straight path through under detailed and unimpressive environs.There is an occasional fork or a boxy environment on the side,which is not particularly exciting to enter,because you will be doing the same thing.That is mashing the attack button to get rid of another group of stupid enemies.This is what you will be doing in the whole game.Later on you get the ability to use your weapon as a gun to shoot enemies,instead of hacking and slashing.These shooting excursions are also generic and totally lackluster.It feels the same as hacking.This minor advantage in shooting is that you can empty the bigger heath bar of a slightly stronger enemy,from a distance.The amount of strategy in firing,added to analready paper thin fighting mechanic,is negligible.There are also some mini games,interspersed between levels to break a modicum of boredom.Retro mini games between levels are annoying instead of entertaining.Developers should focus more on making their games tighter,challenging and more fulfilling.These gimmicky intrusions,just don't cut it.The graphics in cut scenes are okay,but the in game graphics are terrible.You will not be ably to see clearly the faces of the foes you fight against,90% of the time.levels are lacking and are devoid of any grandeur or magnificent architecture.Think of Tomb Raider II's superior level design.The only positive accolade that i can shower on this game,is its rich pulsating soundtrack .Akira Yamaoka shines once again.I will not talk much about the story,because there is nothing to talk about.This is one more D level storytelling with obtuse and offensive dialogues,that are sometimes gross and misplaced.None of the characters have any weight or personality.Lollipop Chainsaw is a below average game and an inherently mediocre one in whatever it tries to accomplish.With no credible staying power,this piece of software is reduced to a bargain bin status.",

There is a small and a large strap on the carrier, so you can either carry it, or put it on your shoulder.

12338,12339,"I really wanted to like this bracelet. Yes, it looks GREAT. The clarity and cut of swarovski crystals is fantastic, and Amazon did a great job and procuring a bracelet that was well built. All gems are centered properly, links are clean (a little rough in terms of fluidity in the chain though). There's no ugly glue, off-centering, different sized/clarity gems on this.Two things:1) The bracelet arrives in two plastic bags inside of a manila envelope. So make sure you get a box to go with it. There's also a tag that says ""MADE IN CHINA"" along with the Swarovski certification tag. So make sure you remove that. Nothing says ""I love you.. kind of"" than a big ""MADE IN CHINA"" tag still on a piece of jewelry.2) THE CLASP! What people are saying is true. This is a hit and miss. If you're not doing much and you wear short sleeves or a dress, you should not have significant issues/risks of losing the bracelet. If you're wearing a sweater or jacket or something that is porous, this bracelet WILL catch the fabric and flip open one of the clasps within a few minutes of merely walking and swinging your arms. We knew the risk and tested the bracelet out when it first arrived. One clasp opened quickly. Merely putting your hand down on the table with the release lever facing down was enough to disengage the bracelet when both clasps were missing. Upon further inspection, the diamonds on top of the clasp itself seem weird, since they're not aligned with the rest of the bracelet. A watch style clasp with just a smooth locking mechanism would have been MUCH better in comparison.So yes. This is a great piece. But it's not for every day use, which is why ultimately we decided to return it. If you know you won't wear it with sleeves, your risk of it catching are greatly reduced (warning: it can catch on the seams of your pants). It looks great, expensive, but the high risk of it falling and being lost forever are too great to justify keeping it.FYI, we bought the 7.25"" length and it was a good fit.",77.0

The customer would constantly complain.I thought I would give ""Pool Perfect"" by Natural Chemistry a shot here as I have used it successfully on less extreme cases. Basically the problem here is that the dogs will swim in this pool every week and the gardener will blow dust and junk into the pool each week with his leaf blower. It really doesn't help that these tiles are light tan in color.So I scrubbed the tiles once again and then I added the ""Pool Perfect."" To be honest I didn't have high expectations at this account. The next week I was surprised to see the tile looking like I just cleaned them. I added two more capfuls of ""Pool Perfect"" and gave it another week. As you can see from the video after three weeks the tile is still looking like I just cleaned them (As of now it has been 5 weeks and the tile still looks great).  So I have been adding the maintenance dose each week now and  haven't had to scrub the tile line.

12360,12361,"I'll say it right now. Gameplay wise, Disgaea 4 is the best of the best in the series and for good reasons. The gameplay picks up after Disgaea 3 and improving it meaning weapon change is still possible and instead of giving so many characters to make and giving them too many weapons they can master, most character are limited to two to three weapons they can master. They made how many more characters bearable. You don't have to work to get a bigger classroom with mana. Instead you unlock a panel on the character map for every chapter you complete, so by the end of the game, you'll have plenty of panels. If you run out out room, the characters are placed in another room which is very beneficial for the player.Weapon change works much better in this game compared to the third so the monsters turn into weapons that benefits them. Seriously, who thought it would be a good idea for a magic based unit like an Alraune to be a spear in Disgaea 3. Here the Alaraune turns into a staff that makes him/her more beneficial in battle when given to a mage.Story wise, Disgaea 4 finally matches the first Disgaea in terms of a lovable cast and a great story. The story heavily revolves around politics, so unless you understand how politics work it will be hard to draw parallel to the real world references the game is referencing. Valvatorez is a great protagonist. Mature space cadet with a great moral standard and wonderful stats that is obsessed with sardines. His character works because he manages to be funny upon introduction. I won't spoil the story because it's easy to put together once you get into it...if you're not too busy with the item world. Which is another thing. The character world isn't available until you reincarnate one character at LV 100 (or reincarnation adds up to LV 100) meaning you won't get the character world until post game unlike Disgaea 3 which is my only negative of this game when reincarnation is essential for the post game.Overall, it's a great game that you should pick up if you're into games like this....Also Axel is back. :D",54.0

But the overall design is chunky.  In my case, the cap and the body of the case are very different colors - the cap is silver looking, but the body is almost black.

I wear it now in my purse, with a couple of threaded needles in black and white, just in case I need to do an emergency repair.It's a good invention if you don't mind the overall aspect.

Some don't keep the drink hot, others do but dispense coffee like a dribble glass; more drips down your shirt than goes into your mouth. This one does it all well. I am amazed at how long I can forget my coffee someplace, then come back to it and it's still hot. Impressive. I have not experienced the problems with the handle that others have described here, but I would offer one bit of advice: if you are using this primarily in the car, get one without the handle. The handle really doesn't make handling the cup any easier, and it causes the cup to fit awkwardly into my van's cup holder. If I had it to do over again I would have ordered one without a handle, but that is my fault, not the mug's, so I give this 5 stars.",23.0

12416,12417,"Had Tivo since 2002 originally with Direct TV. I was an early adopter of DVR. Tivo I thought was an amazing product. I was totally satisfied with my Tivo on Direct TV although I was not able to take advantage of updated software since my box was so old. We finally got a new TV in 2011 (HD) and I needed to upgrade receivers. Of course Direct TV didn't really offer a Tivo option so I was forced to use their DVRs only to find that they were far inferior to Tivo. Lived with it for 1.5  years and decided that we wanted to cut-the-cord and ditch cable. I tested several options (Roku, Apple TV, opensource DVR) and found that Tivo was far superior in technology and functionality. So we decided to move forward with Tivo. The only issue with my Tivo is that fact that I can't take advantage of my Amazon Prime Instant Video. I felt that this was mis-advertised - there was no disclaimer that I saw. Even though its not a deal-breaker, I think it is important for Tivo to develop this capability/licensing.",34.0

We have been on the move since the expulsion from Eden. Hospitality is important and my redesigned living room will enable this. She felt that her years as a teacher prepared her for this.For most of us, loose ends are frightening reminders of our own powerlessness. To name, to label, to classify gives us the illusion of control, even if the closure reached is a false one.In all events, it is important to leave the directee free to accept or reject our insights. Whether we are right, wrong or premature, it is reassuring to remember that we cannot do too much harm since people rarely hear what they are not ready to hear. At the very least, we have possibly planted a seed. As director-midwives, then, we must be willing to wait for the seed to sprout -- if it is supposed to sprout -- and grow to maturity, perhaps long after our relationship with the directee has ceased.If you feel bored by a conversation, the person might be depressed.Like children, directees are on loan.Books should be prescribed cautiously because directee might feel guilty if not appropriate.To clarify: `Tell me more.' `I don't quite understand.'The spiritual director as teacher does not make the connections, although she may make observations, give hints (but without being manipulative), and ask the right questions. Her supportive presence sets the directee free to make the connections; and inner and outer work turn out to be all of a piece.We may spare the very fragile, those who have already more reality than they can bear and are not yet ready to hear the truth. It is sometimes hard to sit with an insight, yet we may say nothing, or we may measure out manageable bits of truth. But with the strong and spirituallymature we need not be so cautious.Can tell one's own story if invited or intuit.The purpose of education is to show a person how to define himself authentically and spontaneously in relation to his world -- not to impose a prefabricated definition of the world, still less an arbitrary definition of the individual himself (Thomas Merton, Love and Living, p. 3)",33.0

12570,12571,"Found this on sale, and being a sucker for deals, I decided to give it a go.  After all, it's natural, and some organic ingredients, and is certified for no parabens.  Not a bad deal.I liked the smell.  It actually smelled a bit like baby powder to me.  Sweet and fresh and powdery.  Maybe not what someone is expecting from the tag of ""Hawaiian"" and to be quite honest, I don't know what a kukui is (one web search later, a Kukui is a type of Hawaiian tree).  Still, I don't know what one smells like, so I can only assume that this perhaps smells like it.  The wash itself lathers into a nice white foam.  I wouldn't say it's an extreme amount of foam.  Indeed, it did better on a poof while it pretty much failed the bath bubble test, but a small amount was enough to lather a full body.  I think I used about a quarter sized amount each time with no problem.I commented a bit on ingredients already.  Most are pretty good.  There is sodium laureth sulfate, which I was slightly disappointed with.  But there's also Kukui extract and shea butter.  And the overall ingredient list wasn't huge. Still, I think it could be a little better, but at least it seems fairly easy on the skin.  It's also moisturizing, which I can agree with as skin seems softer after using it.  And it does a normal cleaning job with skin as most other shower gels.I liked this shower gel, but I'd opt for one with a little better ingredient list should I choose again.  But for the price, especially on a 16oz bottle, it's not bad.Review by M. Reynard 2013",52.0
12571,12572,"We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water.The watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well.Set-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit.Our plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands.Of course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going.Another consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape.So, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly.We did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants -  in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water.Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.",

It provides good lighting for the area, and senses even small animals (cats) from it's mounting location at the roof peak. We are in a rural location, so it also serves as a warning device. I think the only limitation is the mounting bracket, but that can be overcome with ingenuity.

12595,12596,"I bought this for my 7 month old (~7.5lb or 3.4kg) Domestic Shorthair male cat. Right out of the packaging it fit almost perfectly! I had to loosen the part that goes around his girth, but only a small bit. I can still fit two fingers on top of each other in between his body and the harness strap. It should be a snug fit for your fingers, but this is how you test how tight it is on your animal.The harness itself is formed by a ring that goes around the neck like a collar (my cat has a collar and can wear both the harness and collar at the same time without overlap) and then another ring that goes around the girth of the cat (behind the shoulders and under the belly). These two rings are connected by ONE strap that goes on the dorsal (top) of the cat's body. This is exactly what I wanted when I was looking at harnesses because it makes it harder for them to get out. BOTH rings are adjustable (another plus!) and the snaps are easy to open and close.I've started with putting it on him and just letting him play in our apartment with it on. At first he kind of lays down or falls over, but if you put it on your kitty and then just play with their favorite toys they should get used to it fairly quickly. He loves laser pointers and toys on a string!Today I put the leash on with it and encouraged him to walk around with me pulling just a tiny bit (only enough to feel a little resistance between the leash and the harness). He's very food motivated, but I didn't have to use any treats to get him to take a few steps.Keep your training session short and sweet. Set a small goal and once you accomplish it or come close to it be done for that session. Go ahead and do multiple small session per day if you need to, but just keep them short!I don't plan on taking him outside with it for a few more days, but the plan is just to take him out and let him wander around a very small circle with me walking too much. He was a strayand hasn't really been outside since we got him about a month ago. As we continue to go out, I will ask him for more, but we're taking it fairly slow.Long story short I would ABSOLUTELY purchase another one of these in a heart beat!Our pet is microchipped and I encourage you to do the same with yours.

12610,12611,"When I was just a little boy we would regularly visit my grandparents who lived in a small town.  One thing I remember back then was getting to sleep in the old feather bed, something that I thought was a lot of fun.  Of course it was not really that great as it was lumpy and had a depression in the center from all the people that had slept in it over the years, but still it was warm and comfortable.  It was this memory that influenced my decision to buy the 4"" Twin XL Goose Down Topper from Millsave.My situation was different from other people as I already had a foam mattress, a knockoff of the Tempur-pedic memory foam type of mattresses. The mattress was actually alright, a Twin XL, although it turned out to be a little too firm.  Most people when faced with a hard mattress would buy a topper made from memory foam, but since I already owned that I wanted to do something different. I must say that Millsave shipped the 4"" Topper out really quickly and that it came boxed nicely.  The quality seems to be decent, and it feels real good to the touch.  It fits the bed nicely and requires that you only put it under your fitted sheet.Now that I have slept on it for a week I have found that it is really not what I expected.  It compresses very quickly and when it does you can feel the lumps that start to form from the goose feathers. It is baffled well, but does not offer much in the way of support.  I wanted a topper that had the alternative filling but it would have taken 4 months to get...according to Amazons information. This is a comfortable topper, but it just does not offer any support at all.  There is no push back, or spring to the feel, but rather just a puffy feeling that goes away quickly.  You need to shake it out a lot to get the loft back, but that does not help much.  Go with another topper, as this is just too old school for sleeping on every night.",41.0

To me the 1st Gen Wave is where its at.  The small flathead was the PERFECT size and new one breaks very easily.  The new scissors also does not cut as well and sometimes jams up on the pliers when closing.  Leatherman needs to bring back the 1st Gen Wave.Anyhow, the Surge is beefier in the hand but still fits in a 9mm mag pouch (how I carry it on my MOLLE chest rig).  The only noticable difference other than the size is that the outer file has been replaced with a beefier scissors that actually cuts instead of bending material.  The inner flathead is wider, the soon-to-be-broken small flathead is still there, and there is a small scraping blade (at least that's what I think it might be).One of the things I miss most about my 1st Gen Wave is that with minimal break-in I could open it like a butterfly knife with one hand.  Have some gun oil ready upon opening.  All said, I would highly recommend this tool over the 2nd Gen Wave (but not the 1st Gen Wave).UPDATE:  Upon removing the sheath from the packaging I noticed a small, thin plastic sheath containing a file blade that can be swapped out with the saw blade.

There's no spare parts, so don't loose any.It's definitely nicer to wheel around than my old pop up with 4 wheels.  I think if I'd gotten a massive laundry bag for the old pop up, that might have made do, but this is still easier to work with.I definitely enjoy just popping the bag in with the laundry and knowing I'll have a clean bag to put the laundry in to take back.  Pre sorting, instead of all in one, does save time.  Seems like it and the bags will take some good years of abuse.  I'm glad the bags have replacements.  Even though you can cram a lot into one bag, it isn't too heavy to haul one bag by itself.One day I had to leave a wet load in a bag overnight and it didn't drip., because of some laundry problems and had to leave, instead of wait for dryer.  That said the clothes while wet didn't come out of the washer dripping, so I'm sure if I poured a cup of water in the bottom, it'd probably drip through the canvas.  Things smelled like detergent, instead of mildew, when I got to rewash the next day.This definitely takes up some space and unfortunately I don't know if it will make it to intended place in my closet, soon and doesn't look so nice hanging out in my bedroom.  I think I've already bent the bottom wire a little, by setting the detergent\softener on there and squeezing in a fourth hamper once, but I'm still glad it's there to support the bags and what not, compared to the competition.It seems 3 categories isn't quite right for me, but the latter two are fewer and further between, so I guess linens\whites can share alternate and the whites can hang sit in one of those $1 meshes for now. Also, I might get an insert laundry bag, to separate my tops from delicates.  I can probably use the existing metal hanger, to make sure it doesn't fall down.I guess the onlything I'm lacking is self cleaning wheels.

However, although my Android device is Bluetooth 4.0 smart capable (LE) the device does not have an android app that functions with it currently. There is a large amount of finger pointing occurring with regards to Wahoo stating that Google has not opened up the Bluetooth API. So long story short if you have an android device this will not function. You will be able to see the device in the bluetooth settings but you will not find any apps that can leverage it.That being said I did test the device with my spouse's iPod touch and it works well if you have an apple device. There are multiple apps that support this device so you are not limited to wahoo's app (open is the way to go!).If you own an iphone or ipod touch (last two generations) you can leverage this very nice cadence sensor.

Proximity sensor for  Kingpad K70 is covered--area at top of this needs tedious cutting out of the thick rubberized material--with scissors or an exacto/box cutter knife: Not an exact fit for K70, yet workable. Universal fit for many PRC-branded 7"" tabs. Cutout for USB and mini-HDMI exists, also.I protect the tab further with a screen protector and by putting everything everything into an old durable heavy synth-fabric zipper case, as well. Extreme rubberizing makes this product far heavier and bulkier than it may prove otherwise. Provides great protection--until I find something more suitable. May make pocketing, or even purse usage, somewhat more difficult.I'd prefer something thinner-skinned, also rubberized, which hugs the tablet better: This also is a little loose--never to the point at which the tab ever falls out, though. Somewhat difficult to remove the tab--no biggie. Material is so heavy, pulling it outward in order to remove the tab may prove a little more difficult than need be otherwise--no biggie. (It truly is thick and heavily rubberized--never rigid. It's ""springy""--a very good thing.)This makes 7"" tabs somewhat more unwieldy, heavy, and bulky--even than before--not a good thing. Inducing further clumsiness, this even makes dropping the tab somewhat more likely. It should protect very well then, though--given that the screen doesn't hit something. Pushing buttons isn't as ""tactile"" as with thinner-skinned products. (The key moldings for such buttons do exist, though.)Maybe I'll leave ""skinning"" at this, in the end.

12675,12676,"Just so you know, Cuisinart said these will be back in stock May 1st and retail again for $39.99. I went to review and saw these on sale for absurd amounts ($200! Really?!?) and just don't want anyone to have regrets. They work okay but we barely use them. Only once or twice. Glad ours was a gift and not something we paid for out of our own pocket. Certainly not worth more than what you would spend for a dedicated, really good waffle maker. These make thin, square waffles and it takes some time to get the batter mix just right and the amount right where it doesn't run all over the darn thing. Most of the time I whip out my waffle maker instead of bothering because if you are just a teensy bit over, it makes a HUGE mess over the sides and in the drain pan. And if the eggs are too big or small or you add too much seltzer or not enough, it can make the batter too thick or too thin and not cook perfectly. Thinner seems better overall though and you'll have to keep checking but try not to over-check because it won't crisp just right. I just bite my tongue at the mess the husband makes when he tries to ""help"" and pour one while I'm getting kiddo started eating the first one (another reason I take my waffle maker out now! Bit tongue does not go well with waffles. Nor does a massive cleaning job!). Haven't tried a mix with it because generally I like to make our own. I would not trust this to evenly cook if you add blueberries and strawberries (let alone chocolate or nuts). The cooker cycles off and on and so parts around the fruit will be raw or other parts burned. And I only use it with white flour, not whole grains (which we more often use) because I don't think it would cook properly. Even though we're in a small condo and it's a hassle to get out, my big old flip waffle maker (another wedding gift) that has an indicator when the waffles are done has a better overall texture, fluffy insides, crispy outside, pure-pleasure type of finish and is worth taking the time to get out even on busy nights when we just want something quick for a different, fun dinner. I tend to prefer thin waffles too, but the waffle maker really does a better job over this even if they are a thick. Cleaning the plates on this in the dishwasher are easy.

You can't tell a ton of difference between this one and a 16 or 18 mega pixel.  The video camera is pretty good. One thing we noticed is that when you go to zoom in during a video, the lever moves in very quickly so you have to go slow with it.One big downfall we noticed about video taping is with the mic. The mic is on top of the camera, so if you aren't paying attention to where your hands are, you can actually cover the mic and have no sound!  It's also a little small so you have to always put the strap on your wrist in case you accidentally drop it!Other than those few things, we love it!  This is the camera that we take with us if we are going out for fun or on vacation. You can find a case or cell phone case for this and put it on your belt.

Look at the price on that thing, and compare it to the price for the TSST one. It's night and day, isn't it? The amount of mAh on this one isn't that far behind the NewTrent one, but this one costs like half of the other one. Might as well buy two of these if you need that much battery charge.It is heavy though (like a pound or so), so if you're one of those people who hates carrying extra weight, then you'll be stuck with a lower capacity battery, because the amount of charging you get out of this sucker is very good. You can't have it all, can you?

12707,12708,"As a common audience, general appeal movie, ""How Do You Know"" comes up short.  It really isn't designed for the passive viewing audience.  For those struggling with relationship uncertainties and professional choices that require you to step outside your comfort zone, it does a little better.  I believe that's where the appeal rests with this movie.  My wife and I enjoy it because we've been through all the issues the characters face, but it is fun to watch the two main characters in the movie struggle with their own challenges.  The ending (I won't give it away) may fall flat for many, but I believe it is structured to cause you to talk about the movie after it ends about all the possible outcomes.  We've done so and always seem to come up with another future scenario.The quality transfer of the movie to Blu-ray is really no better than a good quality DVD transfer.  It is a 1.85:1 widescreen (non-letterbox) format.  Given the miminal difference in price between the Blu-ray and the DVD, get the Blu-ray.  If it ever becomes more than a couple bucks though, buy the DVD because you won't be sacrificing anything in the image transfer or sound department.",28.0

12721,12722,"The best thing this watch has going for it over other fitness watches is that it looks like a watch.  Yeah, its no Rolex, but take a look at Garmin's selection.  Excellent running watches no doubt, I even own one (FR10), but they are space man watches.  This is a normal size.  That being said, Polar has a pretty terrible set of stock watch faces.  I'm pretty sure that in the future this should be upgradeable.  I used to wear one of the simpler gshock watches (not the ones with crazy dials) and this is a nice step up from that.GPS lock comes pretty quickly, as fast as my Garmin Forerunner 10.  The heartrate sensor matches pretty quickly too.  Its accurate.  The best features of this watch during exercise is the ability to customize what is displayed.  I can't do that on a Garmin.  Through Polars website, I can go on there and select from a multitude of data fields to display.  And you can set up as many screens to slide to as well.  The activity tracker is pretty spot on.  It won't let you select daily movement goals, but it will remind you to walk around some if you've been sitting down for a long time.Only knock on the watch I have is no direct connection to strava like with garmin connect.  You can side load your runs by downloading the file to your computer and then uploading it separately to strava.  what I do is after I run, I hit sync on my watch and it syncs to my phone.

12730,12731,"This is a REALLY GREAT buy.  To try to help everybody really enjoy this product, just a few notes.  First off on the condition:The condition is really perfect because of the packaging Fender uses.  So damage should never be a problem.  If you see a torn carton though, then worry.Then on to as advertised:  I thought it would come with a whammy bar, but it is only built for the whammy bar, so you need the bar.  Otherwise the Guitar and the bag are exactly as advertised.  The cloth bag is one of the better bags I've seen over the years.BIG and IMPORTANT notes:  The neck bar comes loose with minimum pressure.  After bringing the guitar to tune you will need to tighten the neck bar with a 3/16"" allen wrench about 3 turns or so till the neck comes straight by looking down the neck/frets from behind/beside the tuners.  I had to also adjust the string length on the E,A and G strings.  If you don't want to deal with those issues, I think Guitar Center/Guitar shops do setups for 15 - 25 bucks.  I would definitely do that for the guitar within the 30 day warranty to make sure the guitar is within specs anyway.  The point of this whole thing though, is the guitar comes not set up.  To really enjoy it either set it up or have it setup.Otherwise, this is a hot little guitar that has an absolutely stunning sound.  I'm enjoying it greatly!",43.0

12773,12774,"This is my 9th Soundblaster product, and 12th Creative product.  They have always impressed me until now.  I run audio out via SPDIF to a NAD pre-amp, then to 4 NAD power amps, finishing at mixed brands of in wall speakers and subs throughout the house.  The level of the SPDIF out was weak compared to my previous sound card(s), and required more than twice the amplification.  I am not going to be running my amps full tilt all the time to make up for a weak input signal.  The built in headphone amp is a joke.  Volume level/power was no better than plugging direct into the laptop's factory soundcard.  No EQ is bundled with this unit, I had to install old Creative software.  Burn option in Creative MediaSource 5 magically disappeared, I consulted customer service, and was told this product does not support MediaSource (MediaSource won't burn unless a qualifying Creative device is connected).  How can YOUR software not support YOUR hardware?!  How does the Creative sound card model I am using have anything to do with transferring files to a CD?!?!  Creative did not respond to further inquires on this compatibility issue.  Sound quality lacks as compared to previous SoundBlasters, it was dull and flat.  Overall sounded poor, through a mix of Klipsch, Polk, Boston Acoustics, and even a single pair of Martin Logan Edges.  Out of no where, a click and pop appeared between tracks in MediaSource.  Said clicks/pop not present with previous PC/Soundcard.  I have submitted for a refund.  I am going back to my desktop PC, with a Soundblaster X-Fi Titanium until I figure out a better laptop option.  Considering the Cambridge Audio DacMagic Plus or axing the computer all together for a network media center.  Everyone is entitled to a flop.  Creative proved themselves to me over years of use and many products.  I can get over a single flop.  But not responding to additional inquiries regarding product quality and compatibility issues is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  I have used SoundBlaster exclusively since my 8bit ISA mounted ""Game Blaster"" card purchased from Radio Shack in the late 80's early 90's.  Creative has lost a decades long customer not from product quality, but from poor customer service.  Shame on you, and good riddance.  This was run on: Dell Latitude E6540 Intel Core i7-4810MQ @ 2.8ghz 8Gb RAM Win7 64 bit  Sound card was purchased direct from the Creative website, not through Amazon.  However, Amazon fulfills their orders...  **UPDATE**  Creative has finally responded, and is accepting the return/refund.  They are NOT paying for shipping.",77.0

I think I'm finally ready to say that this stuff helps. A lot. It's not a cure-all, but nothing else has improved my skin on this scale. It's better than antibiotics for sure, and best of all there are no side effects.I weigh 135 lbs and take two tablets in the morning and one after work (around 5). I take them on an empty stomach, although I don't know if that matters.I also take vitamin a, zinc and a multi vitamin. I wash my face using the [[ASIN:B0016836RY Complete Acne.org Treatment Kit]]. I took the same vitamins and used the same wash before I started Loma Lux and did not see a major difference until going on LL.Loma Lux isn't cheap, but it's worth every penny.

Can these lost souls find the courage to band together and find Mina?  Or will the evil they have encountered rule the night?",52.0

12854,12855,"First of all, understand what this is NOT:  this is NOT a case big enough to hold your SLR with your wide angle or ""prime"" lens AND a telephoto lens.  It IS a case big enough for your auxiliary telephoto only, but with a very clever twist: a sturdy fold out compartment large enough to hold the lens you just removed from your camera while you are switching lenses.  But just to be clear: there is not room in this case for your camera's body.If you've ever asked your travelling companion to hold one lens while you are attaching the other, you will understand exactly why this is useful.  This is the third hand you need when changing lenses.I think I will probably use this on my next trip.  I use a Sony NEX-5n, most often shooting with a fish-eye attachment on a wide-angle lens, but sometimes detaching the fish-eye attachment, and sometimes detaching the whole thing when I want my telephoto.  My Sony telephoto isn't very big - this case is big enough to hold it and the fish-eye attachment.  There are two side pockets: one has the familiar Case Logic poncho (familiar from other Case Logic bags) that I might ditch.  Note that the fold-out lens holder does not provide significant additional storage space when the case is zipped up.I like the construction of this product.  Unlike some other Case Logic cases that I have used, it is ambidextrous and can be used equally well by left- and right-handed people.",23.0

12908,12909,"I have an HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer) in my living room, and this is the way we do pretty much everything involving the TV. Since I sit about 10' away from the TV, I don't have a wired mouse or keyboard and instead use blue-tooth ones (regular wireless is unreliable for gaming at that range). With the mouse, this isn't really inconvenient at all, but it's kind of a pain to pull out the keyboard, wait for it to connect, and then type with it in my lap. Enter the iPazzPort.Pros:-It's tiny, about the size of most modern smartphones but lighter-weight.-It connects instantly.-Typing is easy and instinctive after years of using smartphones.-Fully charges quickly and then keeps a charge for several days with moderate use.-Sleek look that doesn't look at all out of place on a living room side table or desk.-Includes a mouse function (more on this in the cons).Cons:-The mouse function is sort of bad. It uses an accelerometer to determine the mouse position, but it's not very responsive. It took me a couple of weeks to figure out that you need to point the device toward the monitor like a remote control for it to work. Once you've done this, it does work, but it's still not very accurate.-The remote control function did not work for my television (and I couldn't figure out how to make it work with my sound system, yet). I have pretty much zero need for this function, though, so it's not a big deal.-The instructions are poorly translated from Chinese to English (this isn't a big deal at all, but maybe a better translation would have made the mouse thing more clear to me).-There is no visible indication that the battery is low (which is strange, seeing as it already has a red/blue LED).

As with many other things I disliked, I vowed that when I grew up things would change and I would have it my way.  Along the path to maturity I discovered that if you whipped the eggs longer and more vigorously than my mother did, the white patches disappeared and the eggs became fluffy.  Further along the path I discovered physics and came to an understanding that the increased surface area of a whisk provided a mechanical advantage over my mother's tool choice which was a table fork.  One thing led to another and I acquired multiple whisks for various usage.Recently while stirring an individual serving sized cup of plain Greek yogurt with a spoon, I realized that life would be better with a small flat whisk.  Having experience with the WMF brand and liking the dimensions of this tool, I made the purchase.This whisk definitely lives up to my expectations of quality.  I always take care of my tools and I suspect this one will be with me forever.  My yogurt is now totally smooth and shiny with a fraction of the physical effort on my part.  Once again, the use of a more refined tool has distanced me from my primate ancestors.",33.0
12919,12920,"This was my first time trying rosehips...honestly I ordered them because I thought they'd have a flowery taste and taste the way roses smell.  The tea doesn't taste flowery, but it has a citrus flavor to it and it can tend to smell a bit pungent.  Overall I like the flavor and after trying the tea I looked up some info about rosehips online.  These babies are packed with vitamin C and Lycopine (anti-inflammatory) which is good for arthritis.  This tea made me feel so relaxed and made my muscles relax...that's a good thing when you have a broken hip and it's humid.  If you're not into a citrus flavor, or the aroma scares you off it is understandable.  I was just looking for new varieties of flower flavored teas and happened upon this one and decided to try it.  If you're looking for a way to replace your vitamin C dietary supplement or Lycopine supplement I would recommend this tea.The flavor is citrus with a woodsy/dry leaves taste, but it is pretty good.",25.0

12924,12925,"I was expecting these to be helpful in moving furniture, but these exceeded my expectations.  They are truly amazing.  We put them under our 7-foot air hockey table so that when the ""big"" people were playing on it, the cheaply constructed table legs wouldn't snap--instead, the table just moves.  So, they've saved our air hockey table from an early death.But, in terms of what they were really designed for, these super sliders make moving heavy furniture a snap.  Seriously better than I had expected--put these under the feet of the furniture and very little force is needed to make the furniture glide smoothly and easily across our Berber carpet--no snags in the carpet and almost no effort to push.I highly recommend these.

The insert from the packaging states 80 tools for collectors, but I consider this knife to be a user.Unlike the other Swiss Army Knives which have a Matte or Glossy finish, this has a textured, clear red scale.  This features two electronic components, the LED LIGHT and the Digital Clock, timer, altimeter, barometer and alarm.For daily use, this have almost every practical tool imaginable.  A pen, knife, bottle opener, screwdriver, Torx set, ruler, tweezers, magnifying glass, scissors, wire cutters, pliers, wire splitter and splicer, pen, and filer.Sure you can get multiple different tools but what else has the flair of being all on the same gadget?  This is the James Bond version of the Swiss Army knife and I realize he was Scottish.There aren't many things that you cannot do with this.  Well, you can start a fire with the magnifier.  But, it won't change a tire for you.  These types of gadgets will have some limitations.  Whether you're hiking, hunting, camping or just around the house, this will serve so many daily purposes that you will wonder how you lived without it.This knife system as a whole is beefy and thick.  It's as wide as an iPhone but thicker.  It's almost 1 pound in weight.  Sure, you can put it into your pocket but at this kind of price, you might as well splurge for a holster.This can easily fit into a hunting backpack, fanny pack, cargo pants pocket, Murse/Manpurse or woman's purse.The construction is solid and it is backed by a strong warranty.  Replacement parts can get expensive if you lose stiff continuously over time.Sure, the cost is about the same as a high end handbag, decent watch, a good set of large Bluetooth speakers, or a nice set of binoculars, but the function really surpasses just the novelty of a knife system like this.There aren't any other gadgets that can do so much for you at this price point...especially, at the expense of size and practicality.This is the ultimate knife system.",35.0

12994,12995,"Easiest screen protector I've ever installed on a smartphone.This screen protector is the only one I've ever used that did not have even one bubble once installed on my Samsung S5. THe trick that allowed perfect installation was the solution you mist onto the screen of your phone before application.  You actually put the protector on the screen of your phone while still wet, this allows you to shift it into the perfect position while also working the fluid and bubbles out to the edge easily.  You do this with the included rubber card by pressing it and squeegieing it to the edge of the protector.  At first I was concerned that the protector would not be sticky and stick to the screen of the phone, but once the moistness was squeegied out, it was instantly bonded to the screen of the phone.Nothing scratches the surface of this protector, even when Ive accidently put my phone in my pocket with keys and walked around all day it didn't marr or scratch the protector at all.Since I've botched the install of many protectors in the past, it is also to be noted that the manufacturer of this screen protector will replace it at no cost if you do make a major mistake when installing it, or if the protector ever starts to peel away from the screen of your smartphone.  All they ask is that you send them the ruined protector.  So for minimal cost I feel protected and probably will not have to buy another protector for this phone ever no matter what happens.  Awesome!Based on above I will probably never buy a screen protector from a cell phone store again, the price and quality of this screen protector is unmatched compared to the ones Ive paid 5 times for locally, plus the makers of it sound like they really stand behind their product.",22.0

Skinny Kid.What is there to say about a film that is an essential part of screen history. Ya like it. Ya doan like it. So What! Ya gotta see it if ya wanna talk about da movies.Yes, true, I couldn't stay consistently in character in the first paragraph.Hopefully, though, I did communicate my thought adequately.If you want to understood the roots of the movie musical and what it became, this is one of the earliest polished productions in that history. If you want to see what made the American popular song in pre-Elvis days, listen to the score by two of Broadway's best songwriters, Harry Warren, the Italian guy, and Al Dubin, the Jewish guy. Don't miss the bonus short with Harry Warren at the piano playing some of his many hit songs (while a typical 30's group of singers gather round the piano). Do Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell seem  kind of weak in their roles: the audience loved both through the next years.I can't say I remember seeing it when it was made in 1932, although I was around at the time, but I did see it frequently in the third and fourth run movie houses a few years later. It still enlivens me and I think it will many of you. If nothing else, it will be a compendium of later Hollywood cliches (as well, I should think, of Carol Burnett/Harvey Korman, et al. skits, decades later).",45.0

13013,13014,"In a word, excellent. These are superb quality (made in France), cut like a hot knife through butter and have quality, high density plastic handles that have the perfect amount of grip to them. They are well balanced in the hand and have just the right amount of reach to get in and dead head flowers and roses, snip off clusters or fruits or trim other delicate pieces away from your plants. The main draw is that these will get into places where the bulk of regular pruners will not, and where you require finesse and accuracy over leverage and brute strength. Used for that purpose, they definitely outshine the heavier duty pruners/clippers, as well as similar looking import junk. I have long been an advocate for high quality tools, with little patience for poor quality and poor design. These harvesting snips do not disappoint at all and will likely last a lifetime if properly cared for.At this price point, I cannot recommend them enough. Superb quality and wonderful to use. Highly recommended.",31.0
13014,13015,"Over the years, I've owned several trimmers, both electric and gas - this one ranks at the top of the list.  It was easy to assemble, and powerful enough to cut fairly thick/high grass and weeds.  The ""edger"" function is one of the better I've seen/used - the motor/cutter head assembly easily swivels 90 degrees, and the small wheel keeps it at just the right height for edging along the driveway and curb.  About the only drawback would be the weight of this trimmer.  It is well made and somewhat heavy - so, for those of you who want something light, this is not it.",15.0
13015,13016,"Was not sure whether to give it a 3 or a 4. The color is beautiful. This is a nice looking piece.Very light.Love the pocket in front.Expandable.My one (and major) gripe with this is the main compartment. Let me see how well I can explain it. When one opens the main part you now have two sections (as it opens like a book). Imagine traveling and having to open your luggage at the immigration check to pull out something.......problem is the top part (the part just behind the pocket has absolutely nothing to secure your items but two elastic straps. This is great if all you have their are items of clothes which are long enough to be encompassed by these. If you have tiny bits and bibs then these will just fall out and roll all over willy nilly...So My suggestion with this is that you use the bottom section (which has a zippered part) to put bits and bobs in. Use the other half for a few clothing items secured by the strap and well the pocket for your laptop etc which has to be removed at immigration.One other thing, the more you fill that outer pocket the less space there is in the compartment behind it.....just a word of caution.....otherwise nice.I would say if you are going for a few days and want to pack enough for it  but only want to use a carry on then use a different piece.  If this piece however is an accessory piece to other pieces of luggage then go with it. It may not hold a lot you see.",35.0

13024,13025,"I don't like gangster and prison movies as a genre, and the only thing that sets this movie apart from other such movies is Tahar Rahim's fantastic performance. Just discovering him made this movie definitely worth watching. Otherwise, it's not a particularly great or even interesting movie.Unlike The Godfather, for example, this movie does not transcend its genre and become deeply rewarding far beyond a gangster movie. I loved Godfather despite its being a gangster movie, but A Prophet doesn't rise above its material.Also (and this may seem petty, but it's my review so I can write whatever I want to), there's a really annoying song about midway through by some singer doing a Bob Dylan imitation. Another reviewer thought it WAS Dylan and praised the movie for using his song, but that person must never have heard the real thing. Maybe to French ears it sounds like Dylan, and the singer obviously is trying really hard to pull it off, but it just made me extremely angry.It's not even a copycat singer singing a Dylan song - it's a fake Dylan singing a song he made up to sound like a Dylan song. How dare he? and how dare they give him an international venue for his plagiarism? If they want a Dylan song, dig up the cash and use a real one, not a cheap fake. I'm still angry about that.So I recommend this movie ONLY for Rahim's fantastic performance. I'm going to watch whatever other movies with him are available and hope they have something to offer in addition to him, because great acting in mediocre movies only goes so far.",30.0

13035,13036,"This is a fine biography, revised (as others have mentioned) and graced with pictures and Forest's own reminiscences.  It is very well written, and covers the whole breadth of her amazing life.  It is very fair: it doesn't whitewash Day's crankiness or stubbornness or (to an outsider) her willful adherence to a Church that bears no relationship to anything Jesus would have had any part of, on any reasonable reckoning. The community of spirits and the communion of souls are more present in the Catholic Worker's activities in the soup kitchens than in all the popery and bishoprics.  Still, if it was good enough for St. Francis, then it seems to have been good enough for Dorothy Day.  Whether it is worthy of them is a deeper question.Whole sections of the book resonate with the dire situation of the American poor today in the New Depression; and also remind us of the vast political struggle that went on then to wrestle even some kind of mercy from the capitalist machine.  It reminds us of how much people suffered to bring about the basic safety net that ideologues are working day and night to dismantle in favour of the mercilessness of the harsh Gods of the Blessed Free Market.  And how much of that suffering is now, and will likely have to be suffered all over again.The book also reminds us of the stultifying world in which Day operated, and the dreariness of much of it: the drab buildings, the endless dishwashing and sweeping, the narrow mindedness.  It also reminds us of how early Day and her colleagues were in so many protests: anti-nuclearism, race and Vietnam being only a few of them.  It would be a good book to give to contemporary activitists:  perhaps the strongest message in the book is the need for order and discipline throughout both the dreariness and the wildness; and the essential role of daily prayer (of whatever kind) to keep one going in the midst of the burdens of chaos and failure on many levels.",35.0

Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea.

I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me.

13072,13073,"Very large and hard to handle in the front seat. It also moves the rear view mirror, so it needs to be adjusted after every use.However, living in Phoenix means dealing with 115+ degree days and my car is outside during the work day and when shopping. The large size means over 95% of the windscreen, plus the small side windows is covered when used. The highly reflective top side of the shield reflects most of the sun's heat and the almost white bottom reduces radiant energy transmission to keep your car cooler.The shield is fairly stiff, so it remains in place well being held just by the shades. This really helps keep the black dash board in the Prius cooler.This results in a significantly cooler interior temperature (I haven't measured it, but it's obvious when opening the car).The two downsides to this shield are; 1) The top side gets very hot after being in the sun for a while, making it hard to roll up and 2) the screen itself is very wide due to the small side windows, resulting in a screen that needs to be coiled tightly to allow the velcro to hold it closed.",18.0

13075,13076,"My house has numerous light fixtures that require what are identified as G16.5 light bulbs. A number of these lights are on 6 or more hours per day and, until recently, I used incandescent bulbs. To save on electricity, I tried CFL bulbs, but they provided an uneven light and the spiral bulbs were visible through the light-fixture glass.    I happened upon the GE Lighting model 68169 LED bulbs at a local store, and, functionally, they have been an ideal replacement. They provide just the right amount of light, consume only 4.5 watts, and have the warm yellowish light that I prefer. Plus, they appear solidly built and I suspect will last a long time.    When I purchased these bulbs, the price charged by Amazon was $17.78, but the price at my local department store was $10.00. Hopefully Amazon will reconsider their price, as I would like to buy more of these.    As an aside, many of the following reviews are of different light bulbs, so anyone reading these reviews should keep that in mind.

I've filled them to the limits of their width without the folder bowing at the bottom. They come with nifty reinforcement strips that you place in the bottom and these seem able to hold any weight you can fit into the folder, including instruction books and manuals (I've tested it).  Another reviewer complained that papers get bent or bowed by the reinforcement strips but I haven't had that happen yet to me. The strip is as wide as the folder's base so I can't imagine it would happen without over-stuffing the folder.  The price is high (almost $40) for 25 folders and I don't know that I would have spent that much on these sight unseen. Havin been able to see them for myself I can see how useful they can be but I'm still not certain I'd pay that much. On the other hand, I can't imagine needing more than 25 of these unless you use them in a business setting so perhaps it's not such a terribly steep investment looked at that way.

13091,13092,"This Moen Transitional Deck Mounted Soap Dispenser Faucet in spot resistant, brushed stainless steel is beautiful, clean looking. I used it to replace a very old, no longer used dispenser. After it was in, it really cleaned up the look of the sink area. No soap bottles! Yay!So, like the faucet I installed recently, the actual installation of this dispenser is a breeze. That is, AFTER you remove the old unit. I had the same problem as with the faucet: unscrewing the old rusted nut (plastic disc screw like the one that comes with this soap dispenser but with metal ring under it????). I finally got it out with a hammer/chisel combo (I can't even explain this here). But once that was out and I did a quick scrub of the opening and surface, it took less than five minutes to install. The faucet in this particular sink is not a Moen but it is brushed stainless so it matches perfectly.To refill, you lift up the top and pour. Each pump provides enough soap to wash a substantial number of dishes. I guess you could also use this for hand soap if you wash everything in a dishwasher.It's a lovely, clean-looking unit but $100+ for a soap dispenser boggles the mind.

13101,13102,"True Junk - the spreader mechanism corroded in three short years to the point of becoming non-functional. It had become completely frozen, despite light use.History: I purchased this spreader at a local Home Depot. I used it twice a year to spread fertilizer/lime on a small lawn. I stored it (empty) in my garage between uses. Within three years (about six to eight uses) the metal drive shaft (that spins the propeller) had corroded so badly in its bearing that it could not be freed with oils, solvents, etc. Even an air racket would not free it!I thought I was buying a professional spreader that would last a lifetime but rather I had bought an expensive piece of junk.One last failure: While the spreader was already junk, I put the spreader away in the garage - postponing throwing it out. Come spring cleanup this year - I pulled it out of the garage for trash pickup and noticed the plastic hopper have developed stress cracks and a hole. That is how poorly manufactured the plastic is. And these flaws appeared while the spreader was empty, in storage, in a well ventilated garage!I can honestly state this is the worse piece of equipment I've ever purchased in the last twenty years. If Agri-Fab were willing to ship me a new one of these, each and every year, for life -- I'd pay the asking price. Otherwise - I'd look elsewhere.(BTW: During its short lifetime; it worked extremely well)Free advice to Agri-Fab: Upgrade your drive/propeller shaft to stainless steel and improve the grade of plastic you use in the hopper. Then, you'd have a true winner - everything else is well made. Also - as noted - when it worked - it spread perfectly and with ease. It is a shame these design flaws exist because when it worked, this spreader worked flawlessly.If this review seems contradictory - it is. What you have is a near perfect spreader that suffers from a few cheap components that severely limited its lifespan.",43.0
13102,13103,"I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of using TC's generally speaking but my opinion has been based on shooting film from decades ago. I wondered if maybe technology had caught up and if today's tele-converters were better than the ones I remembered. I ordered the Kenko after reading several reviews figuring for the price, I can't get hurt too badly. My experience with the Kenko 1.4x did not impress me. Build quality seemed good. Not great, but good. The TC fit well on my D750 with no discernible ""play"". With a lens attached there was a tiny wiggle. The TC works best with Nikon lenses; but this should not be surprising. What was a little surprising was just how bad the image quality was when used in conjunction with a non-Nikon lens. Using the Kenko with my Sigma 50mm f/1.4 Art series lens, for example, was a complete disaster. Used with a Nikon 85mm f/1.8G image sharpness was clearly degraded but still very acceptable. Chromatic aberration was apparent however and that kind of bugged me. Yes, I can remove with Photoshop but I prefer not having it to begin with. Auto-focus generally seemed to ""flutter"" and struggle a bit, even in full sunlight, but focus-lock did happen. In summary, I'd say this is a pretty mediocre piece of kit. I won't be keeping mine but I'm really picky about my image quality. For more casual shooters, this is probably a nice addition to the bag. For the serious hobbyist or pro shooter, however, I'd have to say the Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX is probably a non-starter.",56.0

Trust me. When using a cutter for small shapes, that's a HUGE advantage! I don't have to poke them out of each hole with a finger!Cleaning CAN be frustrating, if you're cutting gooey foods. You'll want to do a quick swipe with a bottle brush in each compartment before putting the pushing tool in and running the whole thing through the dishwasher. For foods that aren't gooey, should be fine to just put the parts together and dishwasher them.I personally am not a big fan of the triangles making a heart. I can never seem to get the pieces to stay in the cutter before popping them intact onto a plate, so I end up having to reverse-engineer the layout, and feel like a lab monkey. HOWEVER, they are GREAT for making OTHER shapes, like kites, boats, ice cream cones, etc. And the heart-shaped holes are amazing on harder foods, like carrot coins! With the mini metal cutters, I usually end up with bruises on my palms after cutting a bunch out. Not with this! It feels almost like cheating...I haven't come up with a solution to the sandwich fillings bloobing out the sides or splitting through the top of the bread, for gooey fillings like toasted cheese or PBJ.

I also give her a knife to spread her own, if she so chooses. This is not a problem with non-melted meat and cheese sandwiches, pancakes, fruit, veggies like carrots and cucumbers, etc.",46.0

Yes, it stays in place and does work but a small wiggle will cause it to stop working. For something that is used VERY little, and its ability to quickly move between cars, its well worth it.  Also, I discovered you cannot get features out of this that Honda restricts. One example is MPG. Honda blocks that data thus will not be displayed. This seems specific to Ridgeline, but is likely true to any other make/model that manufacture does not want these settings known. Ridgeline was blocked because the MPG is so low (< 17) they don't want easy to find.  Just my opinion.",26.0

13204,13205,"Great fountain for the price - about 1/2 price of that in the big-brand pet stores.  Has adjustable water flow (great flow!) that can be turned up or down easily.  Simple to take apart to clean.  We have a lot of minerals in our water, so I clean it about once every 2-3 weeks.  While this would last with water in it for several weeks, I like to change out the water at least once a week to keep it fresh (although the charcoal filter does a good job of that).  I have one cat in our household, but I would imagine a home that had more pets might want to change it more frequently.After some months, sometimes I notice that fur (my cat has thick, long-hair) might get caught in the pump and it will slow down some, but with this new model, the fountain is easily dismantled to get to the pump (other models weren't so easy to get to it) and give it a good rinsing.  Quick to do: takes less than 2 minutes to remove top part, get at and take out pump, rinse it off, put the pump back in and replace the top.  Easy-peasy!The water flows fairly quietly, but there is a little bit of a soft fountain water noise - which I really like.  Sounds like a far-off stream, so it is a very pleasant sound.  I know my kitty likes this fountain, because not only does she have nice, clean water all the time, but she liked to drink from the faucets before (which I didn't really care for) and now with the fountain, she'll drink directly from the water coming out of the spout so she is happy.  :-)I have had this same brand before (but in a larger size reservoir), and liked it well enough that this is my 3rd purchase over the past many years.  I have tried other brands/types, but I like this one the best as there is no dripping or leaks (from the unit... when we had the dog, he would lap the water messily and drool/drip it all over the place - not due to any malfunction of the fountain though).This is a well-made and sturdy unit; if/when I ever need to replace it, I would get the same one again.

13221,13222,"I have to start off this review by stating THE INSIDE is a nice surprise.  Because of its premise, I wanted it to be good.  I buy movies from pawn shops on a frequent basis, and therefore I’m familiar with what many of them sell.  As I’ve perused the stores, I’ve sometimes wondered if the owners ever find forgotten video tapes inside of video cameras or forgotten DVDs inside of DVD players.  Director Eoin Macken uses this premise and sends the viewer on a nightmarish ride into hell.  The result is a wicked and intense movie experience that is both haunting and satisfying.I do have to give a warning about this film, however:  most of it is shot in first-person POV from a handheld camera.  Because of this, there are many shaky and dizzying shots.  People who became motion-sick from movies like CLOVERFIELD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT will probably want to stay away from this film.THE INSIDE is well made overall, and looks great from a production standpoint.  It is actually a hybrid movie, in that it combines found-footage with actual third-person POV shots.  I like this aspect, as it allows you to immerse yourself in what is going on…but it also lets you take a breather every once in a while when the intensity gets too amped up.And speaking of intense, this film does not let up.  It takes a few minutes for the plot to unfold, but when it does, you’d better buckle your seatbelt.  When things start to happen, they move at a shotgun blast pace.  I particularly like how linear everything is; there are no flashbacks or pauses for reflection.  When the proverbial crap hits the fan, the viewer is held spellbound until the credits start to roll.The acting in THE INSIDE is very good as well.  I hate to admit I do not recognize any names in the cast list, but I will wager they will definitely do well in future endeavors.  Likewise, the special effects are pretty good, too, although there are not many of them.If I were forced to find a flaw with THE INSIDE, I would have to say the lack of explanation for the supernatural aspects disappoints me a bit.  It’s nothing at all that detracts from the film for the most part, however I, personally, would have liked a little more ‘meat’ in this area.Still, THE INSIDE is hell of a thrill ride, and horror fans should give this one a look soon.  I will be hosting a giveaway for a DVD copy of this film as well, so be sure and check that out after you finish reading this review.  Otherwise, the film is available now in a variety of formats.",56.0

Also, I was saddened that despite Reshiram and Zekrom being on the cover, they are only in the movie for 10/15 minutes.Oh, there was one scene I loved in the Black movie.

I have tried everything out there. Sprays, vinegar, you name it, I have tried it (my cat is a repeat offender). So when I watched ""My Cat From Hell"", and Jackson recommended this, I thought ""what do I have to lose"". If I could give this 10 stars, I would!I didn't honestly believe this would eliminate it, as I have tried every so-called eliminator, and nothing has worked. I used it on 3 spots, 2 of which were minor and one that was bad. My cat got a urinary infection, so she peed on the floor. The urine was a stronger smell than usual because of her infection. The 2 spots were probably only 1 time offenses, but the stronger spot was most likely several repeat urinations in that same area. I tried 2 different products on all spots, and the smell still lingered. The bad spot was still very strong. I then tried this exactly as the directions say, and the 2 minor spots are gone, completely gone. The bad spot took several treatments. I have a [[ASIN:B0016HF5GK BISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Compact Deep Cleaner, 1400-7]], so I saturated the area with the cleaner in the spray bottle and let is set for about 30 minutes. I then sucked the cleaner up with my Bissell, and repeated the process. The smell was gone in the entire strip of carpet, except for a lingering of it in one small area. You have to get down into the carpet with your nose to smell the lingering scent.

The gains in energy efficiency have been well documented by this point and as of the summer of 2014, I've yet to have any of my 7-8 LED bulbs go out on me which isn't surprising since they are supposed to last for years.So what I'm looking for in good LED bulb at this point is the function of the dimmer capabilities and the warmth (aka temperature) of the bulb.  My biggest issue with LED's is that they can still be a bit harsh inside, even the warm white (2700K) bulbs.As far the dimmer capabilities go, this bulb is top notch...it dims quickly and is sensitive enough to work fairly well with my dimmer.  You do have to turn it on at least medium to activate the light but then it will go lower and dimmer than most of my other LED bulbs.  Regarding temperature, I've found that all 2700K bulbs are not created equal.  This one is warmer and softer than other 27K LED's that I have, but they haven't gotten it as warm as I would like in an ideal situation.

After looking at a lot of products offered and the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, I settled on this set.  Personally, I am very happy with my choice. The knives are very sharp and they do their job well.  The knives are very light in weight but I personally don't feel that has an effect on their performance.  I think if you want anything fancier you would have to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional set, which of course not everyone wants to do.  I am someone who cooks in the kitchen 6 days a week and I have not been disappointed by any of these knives. They meet my needs perfectly fine.  I should note that the block set comes with a couple of extra slots so I purchased the Wusthof Gourment Santoku and vegetable knifes so that the block would be full.  The Santoku knife does not come with this set but it is my favorite knife because it serves many cutting purposes.  Overall I would say I recommend this to anyone looking for good quality knife set but not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars.",39.0

If I could be any more wrong it would be impossible! Wow what a great movie! It is an absolutely hilarious Monster parody comedy all in one. Monsters afraid of Humans and Humans worshiping the monsters!The story is about Count Dracula holding up to his promise to protect his diseased wife and his daughter, Mavis. Count Dracula is deathly afraid of Humans and I will not spoil the why he is, but he is protecting Mavis from ever seeing them. He built a castle to keep her safe. Every year he invites all the monsters to his safe haven to celebrate Mavis's birthday. In the movie it is Mavis's (Selena Gomez's voice) 118th birthday, and she is ready to go out into the world and see things.After twists and turns and the Count trying to protect Mavis too much, Mavis finally meets a backpacking boy named Jonathan. Jonathan and her ""Zing"", and the rest I will leave up to the movie telling you what happens. It truly is a very funny and interesting movie.The comedy in this movie is very good not only for children, but adults too. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie is.

However... over time the material they're made of can eat into guitar neck lacquer. In addition, the arms simply don't stay in place, tending to droop down and ""trap"" the guitar when one tries to remove it from the hanger... forcing you to use one hand to hold the guitar and the other to pry the hanger arms apart.    Further, the guitar neck may be stuck on the hanger prongs, damaging both the hanger and the guitar finish.    After several months, I cannot recommend these.

Nevertheless, his bony little butt ended up finding his way out of these regardless how tightly you secure him with the Velcro closure.

Our son would have both of his arms and hands sticking through that opening, so when he lifts his arms, the entire top portion is bunched up between his arms and head- so his neck.

I did not find the guides flimsy as others mentioned in the reviews.  I don't see why they need to be any heavier.  The included apron is marginally effective, I have fine hair it is stuck to the apron like glue so storing it sans hair is rather difficult.  They included scissors but are pretty cheap, of course a good pair would cost more than the whole kit so what do you expect.My only complaint is the unit should have been adjusted at the factory and there was nothing specific in the literature about what to do if the clippers are loud.

13375,13376,"Battlefield 3 was my first foray into the BF/COD realm, and it was a roller coaster ride.I'm a fan of FPS shooters, but I've always been limited to gameplay similar to Half Life, nothing at all like Battlefield, so I was excited to get the game installed, and launched.Origin is an attempt at rooting out Steam as a major digital provider platform. It's not as well polished, and annoying for me to have to install. I figured that I could get used to it, as I was only going to install one game via it (which still made it pointless)From there, I had more issues with several necessary updates, to Origin, the browser, installing security features, being forced to manually update other security components that the programs were unable to do automatedly, and then finally get slapped with an additional massive update patch to the game. All in all, the first day was spent downloading and updating everything.This was also bearable, since the game had just launched. I thought it would be okay.I began having logging in issues. My computer screen would stay black, and I couldn't get into the game. This was disappointing, as it happened at least 3/5 times I logged into a server. While I was able to play, it was great. I was extremely involved in the game. It worked well on my computer.Ultimately, I would have played the game a lot better if the interface leading up to the gameplay was better.

It comes with a external power supply, but I have not used it yet as it powers up from the computer too with the included cord.  I wish that it had two stacks of USB ports on the back and only one on the front as I fill up the back ones so quickly.  The back side, in my opinion is the best place for the connections as most cords come up from the back anyway. So for me having more on the back is better.  One on the front is all you really need as this would be for the connection to your PC. The cables coming around the front are messy looking.  I do like the flip-up connections and wish that instead of having all the front connections they should just do more of the flip-up ones.

13392,13393,"This only arrived yesterday, and, due to the multiple reviews about fiberglass shards or splinters from the pole, I almost didn't buy this. I went ahead and ordered it, but was prepared for splinters by having bought some duct tape (as suggested by reviewers) to cover the pole with. However, tape was not necessary because the pole looks and feels like smooth, flexible plastic. This is the ""original"" toy and pole, so perhaps only the later models are made of fiberglass??This Da Bird Super Pack is a good deal, with 5 toys altogether (1 on the pole + 3 refills + the peacock feather which is so long by itself that it doesn't have (or need) anything to fasten it to the pole because it can be used on its own. For the price, including shipping, this was the best deal I've seen.My cat was a stray, and hasn't been with me for long, and it is a major adjustment for her to be indoors all the time after having roamed freely for an unknown period of time. I really want her to have fun, mental stimulation, and exercise, so I was thrilled to see her play with Da Bird yesterday. What's nice about this is that she can catch it often which keeps her interested - unlike the Loco Laser which is just a tease that she can never catch and therefore has lost interest in. She only plays with her Midnight Crazies balls and her catnip mice for very brief spells. With Da Bird she has all the behaviors & excitement of chasing real prey, and plenty of exercise. Since the toy mimics live prey, I suspect she will remain interested in it. Will post if she doesn't.Reviewers are also correct in that the attachments come apart easily. The largest feather already fell off yesterday. I'm saving it to use with other feathers that will eventually fall off, and will make a new toy out of them.With this set having newly arrived, I haven't yet tried the other attachments or the peacock feather, and am trying to ""stretch"" them by using one at a time until each one is worn out...For the enjoyment and exercise this has given my cat, and the price of the Super Pack, I'm giving it 5 stars even though the feather has already fallen off.",45.0

13406,13407,"I am reviewing the Vanilla Creme flavor, for those of you keeping track, but I also feel the same way about the taste of the Muscle Milk Chocolate flavor.As a vegetarian for 27 years, I am in the habit of making a breakfast smoothie every morning with various fruits, ground flaxseed, low fat yogurt and a few other healthful things, including a scoop of protein powder. I've tried several different brands and while I can't say I notice a great deal of difference in the performance of the powders--how they mix into the smoothie, how I feel after using them for a while, etc.--there IS an obvious difference in the taste. For example, while I hate to blast my beloved Trader Joe's, the taste of their brand of vanilla protein powder is astonishingly poor. If you take a taste of the Muscle Milk brand and then immediately try a bit of the Trader Joe's, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the latter has a taste and consistency that is barely one step above sawdust (please, dear reader, note that I do not actually eat sawdust, but I am guilty of a bit of artistic license in my reviews). Other brands, while not quite THAT bad, are still way behind Muscle Milk in the taste category. This is the only brand I have found which really tastes good--like something you'd want to drink in a shake even if you DIDN'T need protein powder.So having tried 6 or 7 brands now, I can easily say that this is not only the best tasting, but the best tasting BY FAR.

It isn't quite the same effect as noise cancelling earbuds, but I am impressed.Comfort:  Packaged with the main earbuds are two other covers to a fit a variety of ear styles. I prefer the medium size. They stay in my ears when I want them to and are easily removed with a quick tug on the cord. Worth noting is the fact that the cords are very easy to untangle because of the fabric layer.Overall they are well worth the price just for the build quality alone. There are many earbuds with similar sound quality that I have had in my possession. However, none of these would last over  2-3 months simply because I am a clumsy person. I don't even think they would break if I hit them repeatedly with a hammer.",36.0

13418,13419,"This laptop desk isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. Here's why:  1. It was fairly simple to put together. I did it on my own in about half an hour. The instructions were easy enough and the parts were few. There is one step were an actual screw driver is required.  2. It is functional. I can adjust the height to whatever I need. I prefer to sit in the living room at my couch while I work but sometimes I do slide into bed with my laptop too. No problem. The top tilt works nice, though the little pieces to prevent sliding on either end are a bit uncomfortable for typing. I will have to elevate my laptop to make it more comfortable.  3. Product components are a bit on the cheap side. The tops are particle board. The pieces to prevent sliding, mentioned above, are just kind of pushed into the tops themselves. While I haven't lost one, I worry will pop out as they aren't really mounted with anything. Having them screwed in would have been a better design I think.  4. Nice little side table. I had hoped to use this for my wireless mouse, but I just don't think that will work while using this table in the tilted down position. It puts the side table a bit too high to accommodate it comfortably.  5. The wheels are there, but you may not know it. They don't glide very well on carpet or hardwood. I have both in my home.  6. It isn't reversible. It isn't a big deal for my own use, but it could be a big problem for those who move around a lot with it.  I wasn't overly impressed and I think there are some obvious design improvements to be had, but it works. It is a big step up from what I had, which was nothing. Quality and expectation would have been better established if it was more appropriately priced at under $30 in my opinion.  If this holds up for a couple years I will be shocked.  * Initial review.

13430,13431,"I am a fan of this company.  The Tuft & Needle mattress changed my life!  I'd forgotten what it felt like to get a decent night's sleep until I spent the first night on my Queen 10 mattress.  I've been sleeping on it for 20 nights and I am so pleased to finally have a comfortable bed - one that fully supports me and doesn't impact me at the pressure points.  Before this mattress I was waking up stiff and sore and feeling like a 95 year old woman rather than my 63 years.  Plus, I immediately stopped having the chronic nocturnal leg and feet cramps that were making me feel desperate for the lack of sleep they created.  I still get a few, probably due to the stress in my life, but nothing like it was was.  I didn't order from Amazon even though I am a huge Amazon fan and found all the reviews extremely helpful because I wanted to check out this company directly. The whole experience with Tuft & Needle has been great.  The ordering was seamless and my mattress arrived 5 days after I ordered it online. I have had numerous email exchanges with the staff at Tuft & Needle that have all been heartfelt and gratifying. It was obvious that if I ultimately didn't like the mattress it would be no issue at all to return it - an experience you can't get from a regular mattress store.  Friends of mine immediately bought one based on my excitement and experience, and they too are loving the mattress.  I am very sensitive to odors and found the smell of this mattress to be very mild and quite tolerable the first night and it has since dissipated.  It is a firm mattress and yet it still feels wonderful because it supports while managing the pressure points.  I applaud Tuft & Needle for the company they created and their commitment to selling an excellent product at a very fair price, while totally appreciating their customers!

I really didn't want to pay $300-$500 for a longer lens and I'm glad I didn't have to.This has to be the best bang for the buck lens out there. It takes really sharp images, especially macro.I've read some complaints that you need a tripod to shoot macro otherwise you can't get it focus or get a blurry photo. However, my experience has been different. I've had absolutely no trouble shooting at 300mm in macro holding it with just my hands. I was absolutely shocked at how detailed and clean the image was, especially since it doesn't have image stabilization.My dad was visiting and he was blown away with the image quality of the lens. He was even taking some photos with it and said he was impressed with how fast it took photos. I trust his opinion a lot because he's been doing photography for almost 40 years, if not longer.If you want a very nice macro lens you really cant go wrong with the Sigma. I would give it more stars if I could because that's how good it is.Update 4-27-14So far I'm still enjoying the lens but I'm starting to notice the auto-focus isn't very good. It zooms in and out multiple times and still wont focus. Sometimes it does focus, other times it takes multiple tries before it works. I've got into the habit of just manually focusing since it's faster and the pictures seem to be more clear than using AF. I'm not deducting a star because I still believe the lens is great for the price and still takes really nice images. The AF problem is more of an annoyance than anything for me.",37.0

I owned the first version of the  paper pro which was the plastic model and found it  to be a very quality product that after 4 years of use finally broke.  I decided to try this new model since it appeared the build quality had been improved. It has a quality feel to it and is very easy to use and reload.The first problem I encountered with this stapler occurred after only 1 week of use. The little tab at the bottom of the stapler that makes the staple bend inward after you staple popped off completely. I could probably glue it back on, but this is not something I would expect from a stapler that costs 25 dollars.  It is currently being held on by a piece of tape.The 2nd problem I've encountered is in regard to the spring mechanism that pushes the staples forward as you use it. I don't really know what happened there but it just failed. Now to get the staples to continually feed, I have to tilt the stapler downward to get the staples to fall forward (gravity at work here).I really liked the original model and expected the same quality from the generation II model.

The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.This season begins with all the characters going back for 2nd year. This time Tsukune meets Moka's sister, Kokoa, on his way to school. She's a feisty brat, and she's determined to remove Moka's seal and get her ""real"" sister back. There are also 2 episodes that involve Kurumu and Mizore's mothers. There just older versions of their daughters.There is a descent amount of nudity in this season, unlike the 1st. So it's probably more of an R rating. There is not much of a difference as far as the animation and flow of the series is concerned. Thankfully, all of the voice actors have returned. I think they do a good job. I have seen rumors of a 3rd season, and I hope they are true. At the end of this season Moka tells Tsukune that he will be having to choose one of the girls very soon.

The retractible magnetic screw holder is so handy, you'll wonder why anyone would want a driver without it. Sometimes there isn't enough room for you to hold the screw in place, or you need to use your other hand to hold something else.

Setting up the remote was complicated at first, but I was able to figure it out after a few tries without reading up on it, though there are still a few functions I'm still not clear on. Logitech customer service is also great. The only device I've tried that this device isn't compatible with is the Amazon Fire TV. You'll need a hub-based remote for that functionality. The learn function also works well. The remote itself is fairly lightweight and feels comfortable. Keep in mind that you have to sync the remote after any change you make to the settings, and syncing isn't wireless. The included usb cable is required. It only gets tiresome if you're constantly changing the settings or configuration of your home entertainment setup.  Edit 9/20/15: Unfortunately, I have to change my good review. After a few months, this remote has become increasingly frustrating. It was at the point where I couldn't do anything at all without the help button. It wouldn't switch to the correct devices. It even stopped turning on my TV. I finally spoke with a tech support person who spent a lot of time fixing the issue. It's now better, but still has its glitches. I wouldn't recommend.",53.0

Hence this purchase.After a couple weeks of use, I have to report that his tank is considerably clearer than the one with a traditional filter.  Not being a fish tank enthusiast or expert, I have no clue how this is so, despite seeming counter-intuitive.  But it is.The unit is a little bigger than I expected.

13493,13494,"I got this book at my local library.There were only a couple of things keeping this from being a absolutely perfect book. The first would have been more information about his relationship with his two children. And the second would have been more information about the relationship with his wife, Nell.Otherwise, this is almost like being a friend of Wooden's during most of his life. It had quite a bit on information about his early life, his time at Purdue and the period at ISU, etc. I live on the south side of Indianapolis and worked for about a year as a pharmacist at the hospital in Martinsville. One of my best friends from Westfield High School was a big fan of his growing up - had his success pyramid on his bedroom wall, etc.Since I played football, track and baseball, I was mainly interested in his teams always wining the NCAA men's Basketball championship, seemingly every year. I lived barely a hour from Purdue while growing up. Once married I live barely an hour from where he grew up. When I attended my one year at ISU I was unaware that he had coached there for 3 years. And I graduated from Butler University and I knew Tony Hinkle quite well. I grew up with Bobby Plump and Hoosier Hysteria.But I never knew of his glory days playing at Purdue nor of his barnstorming days in the early pro leagues.This book is rich in detail and I highly recommend this book to nearly everyone. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this book. Coach Wooden is quite simply an icon in Indiana as well as the sports world. They put up a ugly (to me anyway) statue in downtown Indianapolis a few years ago in his honor. It depicts him crouched down in a time-out huddle with only the legs of his players as he is giving them directions.I would rate this book a very high 9.25 to 9.75 out of ten!!!",45.0

They are a big upgrade from my Sony speakers. Still running on a Sony receiver that I need to upgrade to. The center speaker is the reason I bought these & the price was cheap for the hole setup can't beat it. Movies sound great vocals are clear and load now music sounds good to no complaints so far. Speakers are a nice size not to big not to small I thought the towers would  be to big for my room but everything worked out great are room measures 16x12.

The build quality and fit are quite good (at least for my large head), and the syncing functionality seems to work well (at least with my LG android phone).  The sound is decently clear and they feel decently comfortable for several hours at a time.However, if you like your hip hop fat and your indie crisp, especially at higher volumes, these are far from the best.  The bass is rather hollow, lacking in punch.  With complex music, the audio seems to slur in the upper mid/lower treble range, which starts to sound like distortion.  I suspect a lot of this comes from using power efficient drivers to help extend battery life, and from the limitations of bluetooth bandwidth as I experience similar deficiencies on the wireless JBL headphones I tried previously.Depending on your needs and desires though, the cord-free functionality of these is worth the modest price, hence the 4 stars for overall value.

The instructions aren't the most straightforward, but with carfeul reading they can be figured out.  I went through a few DVDRs before I could figure out to record from VHS to DVD, but I figured it out,  The good thing about this is it has Composite, S-vide(great for recording to my Dazzle capture card with Amcap and Windows Media Encoder), Component(Both interlaced and Progressive), HDMI(both YPbPr and RGB)(great for TVs like some Sonys that have no composite or S-Video inputs, you can use this as an RF modulator)) outputs, digital 5.1 coax audio output, and an extra set of L and R audio coutputs(wish they had volume control, but don't).  And for inputs, 2Composite, 2 S-Video(which is great for recording from my computer's GeForce3 video card), both stereo.  4 Head VCR looks great through HDMI, as does the DVD.  Has nice manual tracking.  Not sure if it can record to S-Vhs at optimum quality.  Also, keep in mind ""upscaling"" will not make your video any higher definition than it was originally recorded.  But the upscaling is good for cheap TVs like Westinghouse that don't give you many screen sizing options.  Cons:  One model of this has a tuner(ZV457MG9), the other does not(ZV427MG9(mine)).  Not a VCD or SVCD recorder, only plays VCD.  Not a multi regional DVD player, won't even play all region PAL DVDs, though it does play my PAL no region DVD-Rs made from my computer.  DVD recorder does not deinterlace the video recorded to the DVD, which might leave heavy lines on the image, especially with up and down motion image quality may be reduced, compared to a deinterlaced image recorded(through a capture card with Amcap and WIndows Media Encoder or similr program, or screencaptured from a DVD played from a computer's drive) to a computer, quality may be inferior, but the Closed Captioning signal does show when outputted through an interlaced output on the player, like composite, S-video, and Component(interlaced only, ie. not progressive scan).  Has stupid Macrovision copy protection, which prevents recording of certain things.  VCR is incapable of recording or playing PAL signals.  As with most video aplliances these days, you need to have the remote.  No volume control.  No LP/EP option for recording with VCR.  DVD plays automatically when turned on, which can be annoying if you want to use the VHS instead, so you have to wait to stop the DVD or eject it.",54.0

I did a couple ""mini-seasonings"" between loaves and now they pop right out.Regarding safety and country of origin: There are plenty of reasons to not buy Chinese products (extreme exploitation of labor, unfair trade practices, an artificially low renminbi (unit of currency), buying American stimulates the U.S. economy etc., but fear of lead in competing Chinese made cast iron should not be a consideration.  I have done some research into lead in cookware and have found it is not a danger in cast iron. Based on my reading I find that in stoneware it can be a problem.

Their primary reason is for Playstation Now, but the controller can also be used for any of the other Android apps you load on the TV.It has the Google Play store, and you're not limited to a handpicked selection from Sony.  I was able to load a Super Nintendo emulator onto this TV.  I was also able to put an app called Moonlight on here which allows me to stream my desktop PC games to this TV from across the house (needs Nvidia GPU).It has Netflix, Amazon VOD, and Youtube built in, which is nice since I don't need to use my Roku anymore!  You can also download Plex, Kodi, or Hulu Plus from the Google Play Store.This TV isn't perfect.  It does not come with 3D glasses and they are actually kind of hard to find and the Play Store was a little slow loading for me on occasion.I wish the price didn't jump from $798 up to $1299 for just 5"" more, but it's still a great value.

13581,13582,"We had this monitor only about a week, but have been using it very frequently. So far, we LOVE this monitor! The night vision is excellent, and I am surprised by how much I love the push to talk feature- we are transitioning our daughter to sleeping in her crib and physically going in to calm her down just makes her more mad, but talking to her via push to talk works perfectly! Also love that you can play lullabies remotely (fyi the lullabies do not 'time out').  In reading reviews I came across two common complaints on popular video monitors that I would like to address in reference to this video monitor- you CAN turn the volume all the way down on this monitor if you just want to see your child and not hear him/her (we have a small house turning on the volume is overkill) and if you have it plugged in, the video part of the monitor will stay on(for example, I leave mine plugged in on my nightstand- it also has quite a long cord so it will reach far-away outlets).    The only three minor issues I have so far is that this does not have a belt clip and my pockets are too small to carry it around, it does have a little kickstand so you can prop it up on a flat surface, though. Although we can see most of the crib, we have been unable so far to angle the camera (and have not figured out how to mount it) so that we can see ALL of the crib, although I do not think any monitor would have been able to give us a 100% full view of the crib, due to the layout of our nursery. My husbands biggest gripe is that the zoom is not a variable zoom- the only options under zoom are 1x and 2x and because this model cannot tilt and pan remotely, it makes it pretty much useless unless your child is in exactly the right position/you have positioned the monitor perfectly.    ** UPDATE 3 months later: Still love it! I make sure to turn off both parts of the monitor while not in use as it was suggested by other reviewers that that may contribute to some of the units prematurely malfunctioning. I did notice that if you play the lullabies via the monitor for very long, it gets pretty warm (warm enough to perhaps damage the unit if it was too warm too often too long, but not warm enough to do damage to anything else).    ** UPDATE almost 2 years later: Still love it. I am certain there are better monitors out there now, but we are sticking with this one, in fact, we are going to buy an additional camera for baby #2!",38.0

13592,13593,"Rating:  4.5 stars.  Some sexual content.Stand alone read.  7th in The Texas Firefighters series.GOOD READ!  Well written, unusual storyline, exceptional characters, honest and heartfelt dialogue, diverse supporting cast, strong family theme, angst-filled romance, and the author writes very sensitively about the loss of a loved one and the shattered emotional state of those left behind.  HOWEVER, this book is difficult book to read in places, the honesty of the emotions that play out in the book, touch the reader to the point of sadness.THIS STORY follows dedicated ER doctor, Rachel Culver, and firefighter, Cale Jackson, in the aftermath of the tragic death of Noelle Culver, Rachel's twin sister and Cale's fiancée.  During the intervening eighteen months since Noelle's death, Cale has struggled to deal with his loss, but Rachel has simply filled her life with work and study to avoid grieving and feeling guilty about the fight she had with her sister the night she died.  Everyone recognizes the Rachel must face the pain and emptiness of losing her twin, but it is Cale who tries to reach her and share the reality of their loss, in hopes that both of them can move on (cvpl).OVERALL, a engaging storyline, but it is the heartfelt emotions that make this a good read.  This is not a easy, quick fix plot, grieve today - gone tomorrow, but a touching story of facing a deeply felt loss and surviving that loss to love again.  THE TEXAS FIREFIGHTERS series includes Playing With Fire, A Little Consequence, Fully Involved, Burning Ambition, Island Haven, After the Storm, and A Time for Us.You may enjoy the complex characters and storytelling of N.

It was playing at a film festival that I attend annually and was my favorite out of more than 25 movies I caught that year.  First off, this movie was especially well written.  If you are tired of the regurgitated swill that Hollywood increasingly produces this will definitely appeal to you.  As you watch the movie, the characters are well developed and honest.  They could be your neighbor or a friend.  The acting was exceptional and believable as an elderly man slowly loses his ability to connect with the world around him.  But beware -things are never what they appear on the surface.  If you like a good love story that doesn't need sex and violence to ""enhance"" your enjoyment, this qualifies as an experience to be savored.  The plot line is well developed but provides a surprise that few will foresee.  Furthermore, several of my movie friend's stated that when watching it a second time, you catch greater subtleties within the premise of the movie and that they actually enjoyed it even more.

13628,13629,"I bought my first TiVo DVR when the series 1 30 hour dropped from $700 to $400 and put lifetime service on it one year later.  I loved it and upgraded it's storage.  I hacked it to play with it since I worked with Linux professionally.  I even got it setup with a USB ethernet adapter and had it calling on my broadband.  I never thought I would get a competitors DVR.Later I switched to DirecTV with the integrated series 2 TiVo (RCA DVR40 I believe, 3 of them).  The single DVR payment for as many devices at my house was a big factor.  I modified these to enable multi room viewing, etc.  The limitations of features out of the box began to turn me off.  I had to go through way too much trouble to get things working right, but I did.Later I upgrade to HD and didn't want to use the DirecTV HD DVR.  I got a series 3 unit (they were brand new, my wife thought I was nuts) and transferred the lifetime service using the limited time $200 offer spending just over $1000.  I switched to cable, but the cable cards were expensive and I needed 2.  SDV was deployed a month or 2 later.  The tuning adapters took forever to become available and I never was able to get one.I eventually switched to DirecTV HR23 recievers and the TiVo took a secondary spot in my home.  The DirecTV DVR definately seemed inspired by the TiVo and seemed to do everything I wanted.  I eventually got their whole home DVR option and that prevented me from getting new DirecTV TiVO dvrs.My series 3 DVR spent years powered on but never watched.  When I moved into Suddenlink territory I considered it but the TIVo cost too much compared to what I had with DirecTV and the HR23 (and now HR24).

13647,13648,"The JOB 225 is a high-bandwidth, Swiss-made stereo amplifier. It's priced to compete with similarly priced NAD, Rotel, and Parasound offerings, but frankly, it's in a different galaxy from those products.Before expressing more praise for this amplifier, however, I have to provide an account of my experience with it. I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.Once JOB/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair/modification.The repaired/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.Before purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.In all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.NOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority. Yes, you get shipping at Amazon Prime speed from Geneva for $70.",43.0

The options and different difficulty levels on this game open it up for a lot of replay.  I played through about four times when I originally got the game a year ago.  I've taken time off from it to play some other games and have come back to it having forgotten the strategies I used so it's been fun relearning them.    The graphics are pretty good, I really can't speak to the graphics quality but I enjoy the special effects (the explosions, gun fire, ect).  The art style is appealing but not hyper realistic.      The game has great customization for the soldiers.  Some people care about that type of thing while others don't.  I personally enjoy working to advance my troops up through the ranks and trying to give each his or her own personal appearance.

When open, if you need to refill the paper tray, you need to remove the printed pages and close the output tray in order to easily access the paper tray.

13707,13708,"This lid is awesome and it also fits the Klean Kanteen mugs.  I'm sorry Hydro Flask, I can't support your logo, but I will always buy your flip-top lids b/c they are truly leak proof.  Also the gasket comes off if you want it to, so you can periodically soak it in vinegar or whatever to make sure it stays un-moldy.  Edit: I am surprised to read another reviewer describing their experience with the lid breaking quickly.  This is b/c I put smoothies in my thermos and forget to clean the remainder out right away and the pressure builds as it ferments and I can't screw the cap off.  So then I open the little flip-part and use it as my lever to apply pressure to as I'm screwing the lid open and I always think I'm going to snap it off but I never do.  I've done it a million times.  Of course I'm no muscular powerhouse. But I have to say that I've specifically been impressed by how resistant to breakage that flip top is, given that I am applying pressure directly to its weakest point, the hinge, as I twist.  So take this embarrassing story about my tendency to ferment leftover smoothie as a testimony to the flip lid's strength.  Unless you're one of those guys who accidentally snaps the handles off the washing machine and stuff like that.  In that case, you are simply a danger to plastic and no lid is going to survive the terror of your reign.  Why manufacturers are still designing leaking lids after someone figured out how to make a leak proof one is beyond me.  Only 1/100 mugs have leak-proof lids.  How does that make any sense?  You can't tell me that the leaky lids are significantly more ergonomic to drink from, or easier on the eyes.  Are you guys just doing this to screw with us?

Build quality is excellent, as expected.  The clutch focusing mechanism works very well, and auto focus performance is quick and more accurate than some of the other X lenses.  The f/2.8 aperture, combined with the great high ISO ability of the X system, makes this a great wide angle lens for reportage style shooting.  Use it indoors without worry.  It's reasonably compact as well, something that can't be said for all of Fuji's lenses.  Much smaller than Fuji's wide angle zoom lens.  If you're looking for an ultra wide and are OK with 21mm equivalent, you can stop looking.",34.0

There was an adequate and reasonable amount of plastic (not cling/saran style) wrapped around the muddler that was removed easily, and the sticker attached directly to the muddler was using a very amiable adhesive that didn't leave any detectable residue.The weight of the muddler is fantastic, despite concerns that it would be too lightweight. The end used for muddling is quite sharp and won't be letting cherries or other fruit slip around much, but it isn't my favorite for more delicate ingredients like mint sprigs.

13798,13799,I guess I was fooled again by a cheap cable company. First off I will give it some credit for actually allowing the ac adapter to plug in snug. However after that is out of the way there are several fatal problems with this for the HP dv3-2155mx. The first and most obvious is that the white connector is not sized appropriately to fit within the slot in the computer. The second is a combination of its length and ferrite along the cable. The housing inside the laptop is not full of extra space and certainly the total length of this cable and that ferrite don't help anything. The last and most subtle problem with this fit is that the end with the jack has a bunch of wires which do not allow the left speaker to fit correctly after installation.My DIY fix for this was to cannibalize the one part that I wanted (the jack) and solder the old connector back on this after I removed the unnecessary shrink fit and bent the terminals to allow for the clearance for the speaker.I would pay $5 or $10 more for a cable that was correct from the get go. Don't buy this unless you have a good soldering iron and adequate patience for this sort of thing.,20.0
13799,13800,"Purchased unit to replace near same model from Crutchfield that died on the third disc played.  Unit works well - remote compact, easy to operate and will perform basic functions for your Samsung TV.  My cons are the very basic and blah (unattractive) interface.  Since I use Roku I don't have to deal with this, though it is surprising that 2 year old Samsung TV has much better interface/options than this player.  Lastly, I HATE HATE HATE Samsung's design of the rounded corner with flush round control buttons on top.  These are not buttons, but essentially sensors.  Unless this unit is sitting out in the open, you will be fumbling to find the right area to touch.  Luckily with the remote one should not need to use this ""feature"" often.

I place it toward the rear of the entertainment center - where the light is completely out of sight but remote still works (by holding low).  The only reason I purchased a Samsung player was for matching functions with the Samsung TV it's hooked up to.  If it were not for the TV I never would have purchased this unit.",34.0

13809,13810,"This well-made DB8e antenna is beautiful.  I love the plastic red caps that cover the ends of the bow ties. (It keeps them from getting bent out of shape.)  I love how this is basically TWO antennas that can be pointed in two different directions. The assembly instructions aren't the best, but I was able to figure them out. With this antenna I received 54 channels from 56.4 miles away (in one direction).  All in PERFECT condition with no dropouts or pixelation.  I was impressed, and this reception was from the inside of my attic!  Unfortunately, this antenna could not receive my favorite two channels 2-1 and 2-2, which I sadly learned are NOT in the UHF band, but are in the VFH-High band.  This antenna (as it clearly states) is a UHF antenna. If you want to receive any VHF-High channels you will need an antenna that is designed for those frequencies.  Perform an internet search for ""TV signals near me"", and look at the FCC site and the TVFool site. Both sites are extremely helpful, and give recommendations as to the type of antenna you need and the compass-pointing information to help you aim your antenna to receive the strongest signal.  If you don't need to pick up channels 2 through 5, then this antenna will be the best antenna you ever bought!I ended up replacing this antenna with a $45 model RCA ANT751 (bought from this site), and couldn't be happier. I now receive all the channels that my location can receive. (currently 56 channels total)  If you do not own a compass, there are some great compass apps for a smartphone that work great!

13810,13811,"The N252-048-1U is a good patch panel when first deployed.  The issue comes when adding to it.  There is no way to leave the panel in production and punch down on the bottom row.  This is a horrible design in my opinion since you have to choose to setup a maintenance window or use a different punch down panel if the bottom row is to be used POST initial setup.I had initially really liked the panel, but have having a line go bad and not having a way to reuse the same punch down location...I just can't recommend it any longer.  It gets two starts for the simple fact that I have yet to had a port go bad.I would recommend this to someone if they had a small rack that they ran a lab setup with since it *shouldn't* generally be a huge issue to take the equipment down for a short amount of time to re-punch a run.We have since moved to a Panduit PN: NKPP48HDY which it doesn't look like Amazon offers at the time of writing this.

13829,13830,"So to begin with, for our 3 Year anniversary I had bought A very nice ring for my Girlfriend and I knew I was risking something because no offense she is very clumsy and has a great tenancy to lose everything she owns. Well guess what happened? Hmm thats weird she lost her ring the second day she had it, not even 48 hours and gone. The other good part about this situation is that her yard is about 16 acres oh and there is about 2.5 feet of snow. So I am thinking she ran all over her yard that day playing with her dog and how are we ever going to find that thing before her dad snow blows a trail through the yard or mows the lawn in spring/summer. I got it, its made of metal, I have always wanted a metal detector before, why not? So I am looking on amazon and I don't want to pay out the butt for one and I come across this beast. I saw all of the great reviews and the ridiculously low price-Perfect. I make the order ASAP, wait for it and two days before I get it, Guess what, her dad snow blows. Great... Well when I get it I take it for a spin and test it out, brilliant discrimination features, good sensitivity, and good depth. Awesome, but will I be lucky to find it in one piece? I bring it over there the next day and start searching, I adjust all the features to what I think is good and get to it. She gives me a general Idea of where she thinks she may have lost it about a 50 yard perimeter, I had decided to search a little more outside of It just in case. About 15 min later I am right on the trail her dad made with the snow blower, BEEP. You got to be kidding me, we dig up a chunk of snow about 8in deep set it aside and I check it, BEEP. Wow, I thought could it really be that easy? We break the chunk apart and there it is, YEA! It was right next to the tire track of where the snow blower past through. We were so happy, we found what was special plus the fact that the metal detector already paid for itself as well. It sure did its job and I would highly recommend thisproduct to anyone.

13848,13849,"I got this camera to shoot vacation footage on a 20 day road trip from Edinburgh to London. For a home use camcorder the image quality is jaw dropping.  People comment they're watching a HD broadcast of a travel show when they see my footage.  For me its clinchers were the traditional viewfinder, indoor/low lighting quality (which is excellent) and the extra memory slots.  I find its flip-out panel viewfinder handy at times but generally a PITA when you have 55 year old eyes without reading glasses handy.  My only complaints are that the G20 is rather bulky, the 60i recording of very fast moving objects results in a somewhat jumpy/strobe like appearing motion on the footage, and its touch screen and menu system are clumsy for me to use.  Though this camera is pricey, it is no more expensive adjusted for inflation than the flagship Sony HC90 Camcorder I bought in 2006 (and to think I was once impressed by it).  For 20+ years that I've been shooting home video footage (this is the fourth camcorder I've used) one thing has remained a constant: extra batteries are an absolute must!  I use Adobe Premiere Elements and Sony DVD Architect Studio to create full HD bluray discs from the G20 footage.  With PE I customize its h.264 encoder to use all the highest quality compression settings, for its encoding presets are a little lacking quality-wise and are geared towards better compute performance for mid to lower end CPUs.  With these enhanced h.264 settings the generated footage looks as good as the source recording.  I bet quality home use camcorders will soon go the way of the quality point and shoot cameras; cellphones and action cams are taking over these markets.

I was also commuting 45 minutes to an hour each direction to get to and from work, always in the dark in the morning, and often in the dark in the evening, which sucked down all of my energy.I like this item quite a bit. It works. Period, the end. I am careful to monitor my moods, as I previously stated, because I do have bipolar and this is a condition that is supposed to disqualify one from using this item. This is because it can trigger manic episodes, which can be a danger. However, I have been working with my psychiatrist on managing my mania, and my current long-term cycle is more depressive, so I decided to use this with extreme caution. I'm so glad I did.I used it first thing in the morning in conjunction with my Philips Sunrise alarm clock (which I also love, but that's a review for another day). There were seriously mornings where I woke up thinking, ""oh, how nice! It's lovely and clear outside today!"" It was a little bit of a bummer when I realized that it was just my goLITE and that it was still dark and cold and snowy outside, but that extra boost in my mood while transitioning from sleep to wakefulness did make a big difference.I also used it on those afternoons when I felt like I might fall asleep on my evening commute. It gave me that extra kick that helped me feel awake enough not to drive off the side of the highway on my way home.Now, during the summer months, I haven't needed to use it, but I expect to definitely use it again as soon as the long, dark, cold Wyoming winter returns (probably at the end of September).The only reason I took off a star was because the battery life did seem to start to taper off over time. The first week or so, I was getting a solid 4 hours of use out of it between charges, but now I need to charge it after about 2 hours of use.

I do apologize for any inconvenience. Our Nikkor lenses comes with an additional 4 year warranty. In order to receive the additional 4 year warranty, you must register the lens as well as maintain the proof of purchase if any issues occur with the lens.

It's just popcorn.I don't like microwave kettle corn at all but recently tried adding sugar in this popper and it worked!  I put a tablespoon or two of sugar into the pan after it had been popping for a minute, so as not to burn the sugar, and it hardened up wonderfully.  I still like just plain buttered corn the best, but now I want to experiment a lot more.",22.0

13881,13882,"10/10/13  I received these from Amazon around 9/18/13.  I just love these!  I've used them quite a bit since receiving them and think they are fabulous.  I don't understand why anyone would say they are flimsy...this makes no sense.  These are small measuring spoons...how thick and heavy can they be...my goodness...they are as thick and sturdy as they can be for their size and at an excellent price.  You can find heavier measuring spoons by All Clad for $23+-, although I am sure some people will find something to complain about them as well.  I don't know what some people expect.  Prior to purchasing them I read many of the reviews and did see that people had a problem with the magnet coming out.  I personally would not put these in the dishwasher.  The high temp of the dishwasher water may be able to melt the glue that holds the magnets so why bother putting them in the dishwasher.  I don't have a problem washing things by hand...do it all the time.  I would not let them soak in hot hot water for the same reason.  When I'm done using them I'm just soaping them up in medium hot water rinsing and drying.  Pretty easy!  It is just as fast as putting them in the dishwasher and then getting them out and putting them away.  Often with little spoons like this you end up having to hand dry them anyway because all of the water did not get out of the spoon cavity.  If the magnets do fall out we will just use a good glue and put them back in.  It is not going to be deal breaker for me.Also, I read in reviews that people complained about the ink/paint marking the sizes coming off.  Again, the strength of dishwasher detergent is certainly strong enough to break down the size markings..so again, washing by hand avoids this problem.Some complained that they would not sit flat on the countertop.  I'm looking at my set right now as I type this and my spoons are sitting on the counter and are perfectly balanced.  I can see no reason for them to tip over otherthan if you bump them or have ghosts.  People just want to complain...period!These are very very nice and I do like how they connect via the magnet.  I am going to purchase another set for myself and will no doubt buy them for gifts.  I will recommend to all that they be washed by hand...what is the big deal...",74.0

13886,13887,"These are excellent at suppressing loud noises while still allowing lower level noise. I can carry on a conversation while wearing these even while listening to music. The low profile is great when using a rifle and they are smaller more stylish than many hearing protection options.The audio is better than I expected for something designed mainly as hearing protection and the music will come through even when suppressing the louder noise. You do have to make sure both ends of the audio patch cord (included) are pushed in completely or you will not get sound out of both earmuffs.The muffs fold up compactly for storage but they fight me when putting on because they want to fold up. The fit is snug and that is both good and bad. I don't have to worry about them slipping and falling off but I am constantly aware of the squeezing pressure from the muffs. When wearing glasses with wider temples it is more comfortable to rest them on the top edge of the muffs rather than under the ear cushions. There is no adjustment for fit other than raising or lowering the earmuffs from the headband. It would have been better if the headband was adjustable for width; if you have a larger than average head these might be just too tight.These come with foam ear cushions and are replaceable at a reasonable price. Gel filled replacements are also available although pricey. [[ASIN:B00DHVXKVA 3M Peltor Camelback Gel Sealing Rings HY80, Black]]There is a metal loop on both sides of the earmuffs so you can use a something like a carabineer to hang them from a belt loop.While these have been designed with shooting in mind they are also great for yard work with mowers, gas trimmers, leaf blowers or with power tools.",32.0

13909,13910,"The Rock Says...: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment.By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson with Joe Layden.Published by HarperEntertainment.Released January 5, 2000.Pages 304, hard back.No introduction is necessary for Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, he is possibly the most recognised wrestler of all time, a successful movie star, one of the top merchandise sellers of all time inside the wrestling industry and one of the most charismatic superstars ever. Gaining world heavyweight championship gold a total of 9 times in a relatively short full time career of 8 years. The Rock is unquestionably a future inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame.But does The Rock Says... have the same credentials as the man telling his story? As you would expect there is a lot of humour through-out the retelling of The Rock's story. The first six chapters of the book cover his early life, football career and training for his future in Sports-Entertainment complete with amusing anecdotes mirrored by the mischief he got himself caught up in as a teenager. The following nine chapters are devoted to his in ring career, recounting his metamorphosis from Rocky Maivia into The Rock, taking you to the time so you can understand why the audience were the deciding factor in Dwayne going from a sparkling clean good guy to the third person speaking, cocky villain known as the 'People's Champion'. Rock recalls backstage shenanigans as he tells his story, most notably with Mick Foley, Rocky also covers key matches and points in his career telling the matches as if he is in the match, speaking in character, in third person. The Rock Says... follows the Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment all the way up until Wrestlemania 15 against his arch nemesis 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin. There is an additional emotional chapter added before it was published dedicated to remembering the life of Owen Hart who tragically died during the period of time the book was written in.The main flaw with this autobiography of The Rock is it was written too soon, at publication in 2000 it was at the height of his career, being only half way through his full time portion. Even though he tells the matches as if they were legitimate rather than as they actually are, he does discuss certain behind the scenes aspects, however do not expect a tell all, expose the business type read. Overall The Rock Says... is an entertaining read if you are a fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and want to know about his life before wrestling mixed with funny stories from his career up until Wrestlemania 15.3/5 StarsBy Jimmy Wheeler",39.0
13910,13911,"Way better than any other brand especially the one by Rugby which is the worst of all!!This one is really easy and quick to use while contains the same daily value and lacks any unnecessary garbage ingredients!Unlike other reviewers, I really like the design of the dropper. What a cleaver way to manage drops!! You just need to understand how to use it. One tip I can tell you is this: while dropping, try to keep the bottle in a straight vertical position (South direction or 270 degree). Do not tilt it. Do not shake it. Just keep it in this position and patiently wait for the drop to gradually falls. Also, do not hold the baby's mouth until you actually see the drop ""about"" to come off. Practice a few times and you will catch the right timing as when to hold your baby's mouth so the baby won't get frustrated from holding her/his mouth for longer time.A great product!!

Print speed and ink cartridge life are paramount. This printer delivers. While your average inkjet printer will deliver 7 pages per minute, this one shoots pages out at 20+ per minute.  Even at high resolution settings, it's still 3X as fast as any other injet we have. Two sided printing is slower as it takes a small break after printing the first side to allow the ink to dry before running the page through for side 2.Print cartridges reportedly hold about 10ml color and 20ml black.  They last a very long time. They can also be refilled if you choose to do so. If you do use recycled or refilled cartridges, just push ""OK"" when the printer points out you're not using a genuine or refilled HP cartridge. I've found unplugging newer HP printers, while removing and refilling cartridges, eliminates those warnings all together. Probably depends what firmware is on board.Setup was easy and only took a few minutes to get the printer on our wireless network and available to all 5 computers in the house. No problems encountered with Vista 32 or 64 bit or Windows 7 OS. No problems printing pictures from Windows Photo Gallery. It's a good, fast printer.",54.0
13924,13925,"After nearly burning our house down on Christmas Eve 2011 (Yes!  Literally!  I put my stovetop kettle on the stove and fell asleep due to the 102 degree fever and chills I had with the flu!), I was in need of a new tea kettle.  Thank you Lord it was only a new kettle that I was in need of!  Anyway, I decided to get an electric kettle.  I use one in my office and am familiar with their safety features.  I had an impossible time finding one at the local retail stores, like Wal-Mart and Target.  I decided to look one up on Amazon and lo and behold, this one was first in the search.  I like this kettle better than the other 2 I've used in my office.  First, this one seems to heat water up very quickly.  Even my 9 year old son says how quickly water heats up for his hot chocolate now.  :)  This leads me to another reason I like having the tea kettle, no worries that my stove surface is still hot and may burn anyone who touches the stove...unaware it is still hot.  The only hot surface is the kettle's exterior and the exterior is no hotter than a pot would be.  Second, I like the safety feature that shuts it off.  No worries that the pot is forgotten about and may burn the house down.  As soon as the water reaches a certain temp, the safety feature turns off the electric.  Another feature I noticed was a screen on the spout.  I'm assuming one could use this for loose style teas?  I haven't had a need for it, so I'm unsure what the true need may be.  The last feature I have noticed is how much longer the water stays hot inside the kettle.  Because the kettle has double walls inside, it insulates the water and keeps it hot much longer than a traditional stovetop one.  I've put the pot on and been able to get back to back servings without needing to reheat the water.  As marginal as this must be, I still feel I am saving energy with a shorter heating time and only needing to heat one pot's water for my 2 cups of morning tea.  Only downfall I noticed, the opening of the pot (at the top) is kind of narrow.  For someone that wants to clean the inside and put their hand inside, it may cause some issues.  I have a medium size hand and have a tight squeeze reaching inside to do so.",74.0

13943,13944,We went on a 2 day camping trip and brought the pack N play for my daughter to sleep in.  She would not sleep at all!!  She hated it!  We are going on a week long trip and I needed to figure something out to make the pack N play more comfortable.  This mattress fits PERFECTLY in her pack N play.  I tried it out for nap time over the weekend and she slept for 2 hours!!!  My baby only takes 30 minute naps!!  I think this is exactly what I needed so we can sleep good on our vacation!  I also had some friends over for game night and we needed to put our babies to bed.  I put the pack N play with the mattress for her little one and he never moved!

13949,13950,"Just, first, a little background.  Photography is my hobby not my profession.  I have had several cameras over the years from a Canon T1i, to a Sony A55, to a Sony A77, to a Sony A7.  I have just replaced the A7 with an A7r.  I first bought the A7 thinking that the A7r was terrible at focusing.  I was able to try a A7r at the CES show.  I found that the focusing was really not an issue.  So I sold my A7 and got the A7r.FOCUSING - Focusing is really not a issue with me.  I have used the A7r  for a month now.  It focuses quickly in almost all lighting conditions.  The only time that it does not focus well is in pitch black rooms, but then there is nothing to take a picture off.  I took pictures of the interiors of homes with no flash and had no problems focusing.  I have taken pictures of fast action sports.  This camera is a little slow for that purpose, but you can prefocus on a spot and wait for the action.  This works great.  I had a hard time focusing on birds in flight (BIF) but did manage to get a few good shots (manual focus to infinity and capture the bird.)LIGHT LEAKS - I do not normally take long exposures with my lens cap on, so this has not been an issue with me.BATTERY LIFE - This is a weakness.  I have just bought several more batteries and carry them with me.  I have also bought a external charger.  I like the internal charger; this way I can charge two batteries at a time.  I normally drain 1 1/2 batteries during a day of heavy shooting.LENS - There are not many full frame e-mount lenses available.  If you buy the appropriate metabones adapter, just about any lens will work.  I have a TAMRON 18-200 lens (to get image stabilization,  sony has disabled this with their e-mount lens).  I get 15 mega-pixel images.  This is plenty resolution for me.  I also have the Zeiss 24-70 lens to use for high quality work.  And boy the detail really overwhelms me.  Since there is no anti aliasing filter the sharpness isgreat in the center of the frame.  Images are slightly soft at the corners but I like that.  It brings the viewer focus towards the center of the frame.SUMMARY - There is no perfect camera in all respects.  The Sony A7r is the closest that I have found.  It has excellent image quality for a great price (full frame comparisons).  I would highly recommend this camera to photography enthusiasts.  If you are a pro then I think that one for the Canikon cameras in the $5,000.00 price range may be a better fit.  I would recommend the A7r over the A7.  I have had both.  The A7r image quality is significantly better.Happy shooting !!!",108.0

13965,13966,"As I read through Sharma's ""The 3rd American Dream,"" I found myself nodding at every page. His book - perhaps more aptly described as a treatise - is a masterful analysis of the past, present, and future of the elusive ideal we have come to know as ""The American Dream."" His core message to ambitious Americans is clear: times are changing, and if we wish to seize the American Dream, we must all be prepared for it.Sharma himself mentions that the book - while age-independent - is tailored for younger generations. As a college student myself, I found his text to be surprisingly refreshing and accessible, considering the heavy topics it discusses. This was a welcome change of pace, since I was so accustomed to stale academic textbooks that spent far too much time discussing abstract theories, rather than synthesizing coherent lessons and offering practical advice.Indeed, ""The 3rd American Dream"" is a practical text. In Sharma's own words: ""You must have a vision - but remember - one lives by the day."" It reads like a narrative while maintaining a solid focus on weaving together important topics to dispense valuable advice for entrepreneurs, students, investors - indeed all Americans with a goal in mind and the heart to pursue it.As a young American, I see the truth of Sharma's words DAILY resonating throughout our society. He discusses the unique, innovative atmosphere of the American people, the paradigm-shifting importance of the woman-operated enterprise as a vehicle for gender equality, the necessity for an infrastructure that facilitates the growth and development of future Americans, the various global superpowers (India, China, the USA, etc) and the industries they dominate, the various emerging trends in business...and so much more. And he never sacrifices depth for breadth; like a skilled diver, he plunges into each topic and surfaces with a new pearl of practical wisdom, backed by research andpersonal experience.This text is an essential read for any reader who understands the thrilling pursuit of the American dream. It equips readers with the historical knowledge they need to understand their place in history, the practical business knowledge they need to navigate the market place, and the motivational message that, if we take charge of our lives and make conscious, predictive decisions, we can realize the 3rd American Dream, turning the United States into - in Sharma's own words - ""the path to infinite prosperity.""Inspiring. A must-read. I highly recommend it.",45.0

13992,13993,"i bought this chair last year. after one month it collapsed down while i was sitting in it.  when i assembled the chair i didn't think it had a very strong base and the chair just sat on the pedestal post (not bolted together) so if you lifted the chair by the seat assembly it comes apart.  you have to pick it up by the base.  after it collapsed, i took the base unit apart, i realized what a poor design it was.  the center post is held up by a single bolt crudely welded to the bottom of the post pointing downward. this supported the weight of the entire chair!  the welds had broken and the post collapsed around the bolt.  return shipping was out of the question (more than the chair cost), so it sat in the garage until today.  i took a cylindrical 1 1/2"" metal spacer and dropped into the base tube, put the original post tube through the plastic spacer and dropped that into the base.  you must use the original post since it tapers at the top to fit into the seat assembly.  now it projected from the base long enough to sit the chair back on.  it's working better than new! it feels sturdier and it pivots smoother too.when i took the original base apart there were some cheap, thin roller bearings in the bottom of the tube that served no purpose.  the chair doesn't pivot on the bearings, the seat pivots on the top of the post (i checked), the post itself doesn't turn. the vertical bolt welded inside the post tube and holding the chair up is an idiotic design.  when the bolt weld breaks away, the post just drops down into the base leaving the seat assembly flopping around and unusable.after original assembly, i deployed the foot-rest once (a hassle) then used an ottoman instead (much better).since the chair has only been used for a month, i can't say anything about the durability of the upholstery or reclining/footrest. i don't recommend it to anyone.NOTE: this same chair is sold by a number of vendors. check out ""Coaster Fine Furniture Casual Leatherette Swivel Recliner in Black Leatherette"" at Amazon for an example.",49.0

14005,14006,I'm so thankful for stumbling on this particular Chromium Picolinate and giving it a try. It has to be one of the best Chromium Picolinate's I have taken to date and I love that it comes in a small grape flavored chewable. You only need one a day to get up to Dr Andrew Weil's recommended 1000 mcg's and it's very apparent that the mcg's are correct. Solaray is a brand that I trust and have had good results with in the past. Sadly I have experimented with supplement brands I have never heard of before and found that the mcg's were likely a lot less than stated on the label. I'll be re-ording these by Solaray again and again. As others have mentioned it feels as if this lozenge form is being absorbed better.As with any supplement it's always important to talk with your physician first. The nice thing about Chromium Picolinate is it's been around for many years now and is pretty well known among health care givers unlike the newer fad supplements.,28.0

The Velcro straps have held strong and the product was very easy to install. My bath spout is very similar to the one pictured but I imagine it would not work on anything much different than that due to it's design and the plastic support arm that goes underneath.  I am not able to adjust the water pressure when filling the tub (it's just one single handle) so some of the water doesn't get filtered but I'd say at least 90% does which is a lot better than nothing in my opinion.Our water doesn't have an odor so I can't say whether it helps with that or not but I did notice that my skin felt significantly less dry than normal after two baths so I'm confident it's working.,11.0

The EQ is very nice because they kept it simple. I also like the compression. It seems like most Bass Amp makers have gotten away from adding compression in the last 10 years. All in All it isn’t a bad amp/sound but Warwick really over hyped it. The advertisement makes it sound like it has the best sound out there in the Class D market and it simply is not true. You can find better by doing your research and trying one out. I bought one because of the advertisement and was pretty excited about the dual channels.

I had washed him inside a pillowcase on the gentle setting as the instructions explain.  After the first wash, before any use, the ear came undone, and I contacted the company for a replacement.  They required me to take a bunch of pictures, make a bunch of phone calls, and email them before they would send a replacement.  All over a $10 product.

They were twice or even three times as expensive as the competition, but considering that a pair could be washed and used thirty times or more before wearing out, they were still the best deal in town. Buying 12 pairs at a time, all looking the same of course, would set me for a year.Then a few years ago I noticed something had happened. Gold Toe had become strangely affordable, only somewhat more expensive than the generic brands. The next thing I noticed was after a couple of washes, some of them had shrunk, others had holes in them, and within short just about all of them had worn out. Being a long time Gold Toe fan, i hoped it was just a bad batch, so gave them one more chance. Same thing. I am guessing Gold Toe has, like so many other companies, fired their workers and are simply slapping their label on production runs from the same sweat shops that make the regular generic wear and dispose clothing.I no longer buy Gold Toe as I see little reason to pay extra without getting anything extra. If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears.",22.0

Everything looked great on regular tv broadcast until I got to the game and noticed the scaling mostly when the teams lined up and the camera shot was panned out. The tv could not keep up with all the little legs going every where and you could see some scaling for a second and you would say what was that. This was very noticeable to me because my old TV did not do this. This happened intermittingly through out the game but not all the time.  This is not a true 240hz refresh rate but Vizio's make believe version of it. Still debating on sending it back... Everything else is great and normal TV looks awesome. Update.... Ended up keeping do to it was so close to super bowl and I needed for a party.

14201,14202,"I'm a semi pro photographer, that likes to work on a budget. So I decided to try out this bad boy. I do believe that the price is not a fair price for what you are getting and plus Fotodiox is at the same time selling the same item but just not for a speed light but for an Alien Bee strobe and different mount for about $90. Now, I bring this up because I don't feel that the speedlight mount bracket is of much value due to it not being strong enough to hold the beauty dish without using a pair of pliers to tighten it. I use a mix of speedlights and portable strobes. Honestly, this beauty dish works great with strobes when using the correct strobe mount to the beauty dish, but Fotodiox needs to make their speedlight mount brackets better (stronger) and more suited for the beauty dish. Also be very careful about not dropping this on the ground too hard. One, the mental is soft and nowhere near a Mola dish and also the way they have connected the dish to the mount on the back isn't sturdy at all. Mine fell to the ground and the little rivets holding it together pulled out and I had to take some bolts and nuts and re-attach them together. So now it's much stronger, but only because I myself did it. Also before buying this dish, think about if you want to use grinds on it, because I now know that it is not an easy task finding the same size grinds and degrees as other size beauty dishes. All and all this is a good alternative to the other expensive dishes out there and it is also very versatile due to the ability to change the mounts you can use with it. The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the price vs. the same size model they sell for $90, and if the price reflects the add on of the speedlight bracket mount then they need to improve the mount to justify the price. The time and effort it can take to ensure that you have a secure hold is unnecessary. Also I'm sure over time the brackets ball joint will loss its hold the more you use it.",37.0
14202,14203,"These are great if...You stick with the darker colors.  I thought the Butter Cream would drive me to huff it.  The lighter colors are more powdery while the dark more slick.  The result is easier coverage and both a better appearance and wear.  The lighter shades create a huge cloud of powder which covers you and chips much easier defeating the entire purpose of repainting.  My faves are this Navy and the Burgundy.  Also good were the OSHA Orange and the school bus Yellow.  The White looks very institutional, like nurses shoe's white, and was totally unappealing.  I used these paints to repaint a ton of old plastic garden containers.  The only ones to end up looking like something cheap from Home Depot were the white ones.  We hated them so much on our patio, we donated them to our building to be used elsewhere.Prep the surface!  Just b/c it says you don't have to do too much for prep, go online and learn about prepping plastic for painting.  The ones I prepped more have fared better.  Also, don't expect too much.  If you are reckless with them, they will scratch and chip.  I was careful and am happy.  However, I declined painting the plastic chairs my bldg has on the common patio, something I had planned to do.  I do not think these paints, even the darker colors could withstand the abuse a plastic stacker chair endures.  So, for something somewhat stationary, you shouldn't have issues.You stick to less expensive colors. The prices fluctuate wildly from $12 for a can of White to $2.50 for a can of Burgundy and are constantly changing.  Next month the White could be $3 and the Burgundy, $12.  Some of the colors go far and some = 1.5 - 2 cans to get a 20"" planter painted.  Suddenly your cheap dress-up for a plastic planter costs $25.  Add the labor + time and other materials like mask, gloves, drop cloths, it makes more sense to recycle your old ones and buy new.  So try to choose cheaper colors especially at first as your learning to use it for maximum coverage etc.So, I do recommend the product if you are willing to go the necessary distance not to be unhappy with the results.",72.0

14213,14214,"I had a rocky start with the Gatorskin, catching 3 rear flats in the first 3 weeks after putting these on (they were all legit flats; 2 goathead thorns and 1 bit of wire probably blown out of car radial tires) last October. Since then I've had only 2 flats in 7 months, though, and I ride through a lot of broken glass debris in the streets of San Diego, CA.The Gatorskin is thick and heavy, but then I ride aluminum roadie, so I don't mind a few extra ounces. New tire takes a bit of kneading to get on, but if you knead it right you don't need to use tire levers to help. The PSI info on the tire is pretty hard to read (it's obscured by the yellow thread on the sidewall), but mine list max PSI at 120. I'm pretty light (130 lbs), though, and usually run them between 85-90 PSI for softer riding and lower rolling resistance. Never had pinched flat on them and they run great.The rear Gatorskin developed 'square top' after about 1000 mile or so. 750 miles later it is still working well and has plenty of meat left (and I've been riding off road a bit with my road bike... They've gone up Nate Harrison Grade, Black Canyon Rd, and Mother Grundy Truck Trail without much problem (they do skid when you climb 14% grade ramps on loose gravel, but that's about it). I don't rip it down curvy mountain roads because I'm aware of the squared top rear tire and the tires handle just fine down things like Palomar South Grade Rd or Mesa Grande Rd or Honey Springs Rd.Bottom line: I got these tires for their hardiness and they are indeed very hardy. They were pretty sticky when new, but that wore off within a week or two. Now they grip fine on normal road condition and even when the road is a bit wet (I go safely slow when wet, though, so I don't know how they do if you want to race with them in wet weather).",22.0

The color is fantastic. Because these are made from sterilized human hair they don't have that glossy look synthetic ones usually do and are gorgeous with a generous application of mascara to maximize volume, if you desire (which is what I did in my photo). Because these have a spaced out lash line on the band to look like your very own fringe they look somewhat toothy on the lid up close which is easily solved by a swipe of dark shadow or a smokey eyeliner. Once that's done you can't see a thing.

I flicked the switch to the on position and pulled the chain for the light and for the fan. Neither one operated the fan. I would have tried the remote, but the toggle switches appeared to be broken inside of it. The purchase occurred over 3 months ago as we purchased the fan in preparation for a new home to be completed. Unfortunately, because the builder delayed their construction timeline the normal return window expired before we opened the box to install it. Since I was unable to use the remote to try to turn on the fan, I continued to use the pull chains to operate the fan.Thinking that I possibly hooked up the wires incorrectly, I disassembled the fan and started over again. After completely rewiring all of the wires again, I went and tested the fan and again it did not work. At this point, being totally frustrated, I rewired the entire fan without the remote receiver and it ran fine, or so I thought.There were approximately 5 red screws that needed to be removed to allow the blades to self balance. After the red screws were removed there was still a HUGE wobble in the fan when it ran on any speed other than the lowest speed. Thus the self correcting - AUTO BALANCE feature did not work.When rating a fan I would think most consumers are looking for some of the same items I was and so I am rating the overall categories as follows:Cosmetic/Appearance- 4 starsEase of Installation- 1 star- Too many parts compared to competitor fans in similar price rangeReliability- 1 star - Remote and auto balance feature did not workCost- 1 star- Competitor Fans with similar features to the Hunter model cost lessFeatures/Benefits- 1 star- Features do not workOverall Rating- 1 star- It looks good but just doesn't work.I am sure Hunter makes good fans, but this isn't one of them.",35.0

It is not offered in any other color top, so I painted mine, but due to the softness of the wood, I am going to replace the top or have it covered with a stone top.  I can't say enough about the quick assembly process.  It took us less than an hour to assemble, as a lot of the product comes pre-assembled.

14254,14255,"For the price, this kit is a real winner. That said though, the CFLs included in this kit are epic failures. I read some reviews about the bulbs failing or catching on fire, but assumed that would be unlikely. While I didn't have any ""fiery"" experiences, I encountered a close-second when the large 105wt CFL began smoking - yes, literally - and then flickered out moments later. At that time I was more than a bit concerned and went to check the other 105wt bulb and found that the base was incredibly hot (especially for a CFL) and that it too smelled like an electrical fire. I decided to opt for safety and take that bulb out as well. I should also add that the bulbs had only been on for about 30 minutes - which brought their grand lifespan to about 2.5 hours.OK, enough about junky bulbs from China. The rest of the kit: The stands aren't particularly heavy duty, but definitely up to the task for what I need them for - and I think as long as they're treated relative care, you (and I) will get lots of life out of them. I just used them for a video project and the lighting was great. I didn't need to use the backdrops, but found the other stands as a great help for various gear and other clamp lights I use.The backdrops themselves are a bit sheer, but still decent quality considering the overall price of the kit. If you look at them as a ""free bonus"" in the kit, you won't be disappointed - but they won't compare with the better, pricier muslin you can buy. The only concern you'd need to address is lighting behind the backdrops popping through. If you can keep that in check, they will work great.I know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed with the bag - it's a great size, and decent quality. Everything fits right back in the bag without hours of careful planning. Tear the gear down and then stick it in the bag. Zip. Tada! So many bags are the exact size of the equipment, so unless you have a degree in space planning or zippered-duffle-bag management, you're bound to spend a fair bit of time stuffing it all back in there. Not so with this bag - plenty of space for the kit, and I was even able to toss a bag of quick clamps in there and some additional bulbs... yeah, remember those bulbs I mentioned above? Glad I thought to bring backups.So the final verdict? It's a great deal. The bulbs may burn your house or studio down, but if you keep a fire extinguisher handy (or just don't use them at all), you'll be quite pleased to enjoy the nice, even lighting and decent backdrop kit.",66.0

14266,14267,"I'm relatively new to playing drums, but I listen critically to every instrument related to drumming -- I'm an audio engineer, primarily.I started out with a set of Zildjian K Custom Hybrid 13 1/4"" hi-hats.  These hats had a very bright, aggressive ""chick"" sound, but to get any sort of tightness out of them, you'd have to practically stand on the pedal.  For more open-hat playing styles, they were great, but that's not what I was looking for.  I wanted a more versatile set of hats.  After listening to, and playing, a number of hi-hats by Zildjian, Paiste, and Meinl, I was starting to wonder if I'd ever find the hats I wanted.I saw a used pair of Paiste Dark Crisp 13"" hats on display at a store in their cymbal room.  Since they were set up on a hat stand already, I gave 'em a chick.  My eyes widened.  I started working them with sticks, all the way from full closed to wide open.  AMAZING!  Brightly crisp on the top, but with a low pitch.  I immediately asked if I could put these hats on a kit, next to what was previously my front runner choice: Zildjian A Custom 14"" hats.  I played both sets of hats, and the 13"" Dark Crisp hats won handily.  I hadn't intended to buy hats that day, but I snapped them up.A professional drummer friend of mine had great hats -- Zildjian K custom bottom, and A custom top, 13"".  He loved them, but after 12 years of hard playing, they finally cracked.  He asked to borrow mine for a show he was playing, despite being a staunch Zildjian fan -- now he wants a set of his own.Bottom line:  These hats are crisp, they cut through the mix, and they're incredibly responsive to the way you play them.  They also sound great recorded!  This is a sound that I could see working for most genres of music.  They're probably not appropriate for very loud, hard playing, but they're absolutely appropriate for anything played at moderate levels where finesse and tone take precedence over volume.",58.0

14277,14278,"P3P is one of the best games I have ever played. Simply put, it is solid on every front. If you enjoyed P3 on the console and you own a PSP, P3P should be high on your priority list. If you're new to the Persona series, it is still a great place to start because the Persona series does not build off of the stories of previous games.It blends elements of P4 and P3, resulting in an altogether refreshing and engaging gameplay. For example, you no longer have to depend on your allies' AI and instead can give them direct commands. This makes strategy easier to execute and you don't have to worry so much about whether or not your allies will run out of SP or heal you at crucial moments. You also experience different social links and most notably, can choose the gender of the protagonist. The navigation is different, as well, but I find it more efficient than in the console versions. The only thing I wish would have been added was allowing you to continue fighting even if your protagonist is knocked unconscious.The only things to be wary of are the difficulty settings and the names of skills/spells. Although you may have played strategic turn-based games, they are not exactly like Persona. If you are new to these types of games, start on an easy setting. The easy settings allow you to continue the game after your death instead of restarting from the last save, and they allow you to focus on getting comfortable with other aspects of the game (not just fighting). Persona games have a tendency to use instant death spells on your protagonist, thus killing you instantly. Also, fusing personas can be confusing since the game doesn't give you guides for each one. Secondly, the names of spells and skills can be confusing. Basic fire spells are called ""agi"", ice spells ""bufu"", wind spells ""garu"", etc. Spells that attack multiple enemies at once begin with ""ma"". The naming scheme is simple once you get used to it, but it's not very straightforward.",50.0

Went to Youtube for live instruction in order to install it correctly on my 2002 Tundra (also upgraded all my other original bulbs with LED bulbs from Amazon). The outcome is unbelievable. I would say it is a big difference between my old light sets and the new one. Wife and kids really love it. Now they want to drive along with me wherever the truck needed versus my brand new 2013 Lexus RX350 and Buick Enclave(both with HID headlights). I would really recommend this kit to any one. Come on no brainer with the price around $100 buck and about another $20 for all the small LED bulbs will entirely change the look of your old and undated vehicle into more modern look and more importantly much safer at night.,25.0

I couldn't get as smooth a look as with regular caulk, but I was applying it at an awkward angle over my head.  Certainly it was much quicker and easier than using a caulk gun.

In the meantime, the product had already shipped, and the charge to my card was processed. Long story short, Wayfair was definitely WAY FAIR about it!

I ended up getting the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification, as advertised, from optics planet. This scope is phenomenal!!! I have a lower end Gen 1 monocular, and compared to that, the difference is literally night and day. I set up with it the other night, with about 25% of the moon lit up, and watched some coyotes about 400 yards away. I could nearly count their teeth!!! The only downside to this scope is that I can see farther than I feel confident shooting with the gun I have it mounted on.Before the moon comes out, when its pitch black, it still provides a decent picture. With the IR spotlight that comes with it, you can see about 100 yards with no other light, as long as youre not getting a reflection from nearby objects.All in all, the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification is worth it.",44.0

14362,14363,"I ordered this product based on the reviews but was pretty disappointed. I tried it on as soon as it arrived and was excited because I've tried so many different BB creams and this one was said to be the best... I spent 10+ years as a beauty consultant and have tried various foundations and BB and CC creams, expensive and inexpensive. Sadly, I didn't think this was even mediocre.I rated it 2 stars because some of the ingredients have good skin benefits and it smells great and was packaged nicely. Lol, that's all I really liked about it. Well, and the price of course but it was money wasted because I won't likely wear it!The 02 Medium was quite orange on me. I'm of Southeastern descent, for reference, I have a bit of an olive undertone and usually wear medium beige tones... This color would match well on someone who has done a good share of fake tanning.... Noticeably orange.I have combination oily skin. Slightly oily in the T-zone and normal everywhere else. For me, this product went on too dry. Maybe because of the SPF but so dry, it was difficult to blend. Being that the color was dark for my skin, I warmed it up in my fingers to apply it thinly but still it didn't apply evenly.My biggest gripe was that I was wearing a white tee and quickly found that it doesn't set well. It rubs right off with hugs, drips off if sweaty, and just didn't have any staying power. I hadn't used my usual setting spray or any powder though because I quickly found this product disappointing and decided to not spend more time on it.It did cover well without using too much product but as said, was too dry for my liking. It made my skin feel nicely tightened though and maybe with more use would have more benefits but I'm not feeling led to buy more in a lighter color.Since initially trying it, I've gotten more sun and developed a nicer tan. I tried this again but the hue was still just too orange. I'd use it under my eyes for concealing dark circles if it had better staying power.Uploaded some photos for reference.

14419,14420,"I used this for a theater gig while playing keyboard. The light not only brightened up every inch of the music on the stand but also my entire 88-key keyboard, without blinding a single audience member. The LED lights never produce heat, allowing me to adjust the light at any time without risk of burning myself. The flexible neck allows for any creative positioning imaginable, holding any position for an unlimited amount of time.If there is anything to critique, it is the clip itself, which doesn't hold quite as securely to my music stand as I would hope, though there is no risk of it falling off, it just may wiggle a bit. However, once it is set to my liking, it really only wiggles when I try to do so. No movement occurs just from setting a book on the stand or turning pages.Although I haven't used it for any purposes beside reading music, I'm sure other creative uses would prove effective as well. The option to either use AC power or batteries is very nice, as you don't need to waste battery power when you can conveniently plug it in. Keep a twist-tie or rubber band handy though, as the power cord is quite long.The bag is nice for storing and keeping off dust when not in use. I was attracted to the fact that the light uses cheaper AA batteries as opposed to the more expensive AAA or coin batteries, and it comes with the batteries, too. Considering the quality and all the accessories, I don't foresee needing to spend any bucks on this or any new light for quite awhile.",29.0
14420,14421,"I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so... I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant ""popping"" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise,unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)    (edited: the gameplay itself is fun and it delivers in that aspect. I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)",47.0

I made sure I didn't tighten the bolts in the arms and in the back of the chair until I had all of them in place and halfway screwed in.  I think there were only 8 screws that involved screwing on the arms to the chair.  I didn't have any difficulty.  I did it by myself and did not need any assistance from my husband.

14432,14433,"I was very impressed with this product. Did an excellent job of conditioning the leather. Leaves leather very hydrated and extremely soft, even removes surface scratches. Make sure you wipe off any excess after the conditioner has completely soaked in, even if you can't see it, otherwise the surface will feel very sticky. Looks like honey and feels like honey, especially if you don't wipe down after soaking in. Leather Honey lasts much longer than any other product I have used, 4-6 months with normal use. The only drawback is the leather will darken quite a bit. Not a problem on black leather but your light browns will turn to dark brown after you apply. If you want to preserve the color I recommend Bick 4. Doesn't last as long or hydrate the leather as well as Leather Honey but it will not darken the leather but a very very small amount.

Do not believe you can find a better guitar speaker for the money.. these are dirt cheap 70 -75 bucks for a pair.They are nice and shimmery on clean settings- have good mids and highs. A little weak on lower frequency but you can dial in to compensate. They break up nice. Not floppy  and not harsh sounding. Also compared them to Jenson ceramic C10. The C-10 had greater mid range and were in my opinion a little muddy sounding in comparison. They are a bit tight but suspect will loosen up  with break in. Overall pleased.

14491,14492,"I ordered the rising moon one for my girlfriend and I couldn't resist getting the sunset one for myself in the process. They are both a little darker than the photos but none the less vibrant and awesome to look at. Aesthetics aside, I did a lot of research before I ordered these mats, and in terms of price and quality Aurorae is definitely giant strides ahead of most others in the mat manufacturing business. We've owned mats before that were more expensive than these and lasted quite awhile, but were nowhere near as comfortable and well made. I highly recommend giving your mats a good bath before you use them. You're not supposed to use oil based detergents but we'd run out of Dr B's non oil-based castile soap and just used the lavender oil-based one which worked fine, (not surprising since it's such an awesome soap) then set the mats out to dry in the sun. I've come to find that no matter how you wash your mat, this step is very important. The sun further removes the resin that's been applied before shipping. Bottom line? This mat is thicker, longer, more durable, and made with better material than most other mats you'll find for this price. As an added bonus, the designs are really cool and the customer service is prompt and personable. You can't go wrong with one of these beautiful mats.",38.0

14534,14535,"This is a later edit to my review below. I'm putting it up top, because I want to share my recent success in getting six mice in three days with this zapper -- finally wiping out the last of the group that had taken over my kitchen. (I think. I still have it baited and ready just in case.)I accomplished this by trying a new bait technique. (Inspired by another reviewer who mentioned baiting his with boiled chicken, and one more reviewer who mentioned leaving them baited but turned off initially, so the varmints got use to it first.) What I did was shred up a little leftover meat (chicken, turkey or beef) and put one chunk down at the far end, as instructed to set off the trap. But also put another shred about a third of the way in, just over the first diagonal bar in the ""floor,"" where it wouldn't trigger the current yet.I put the trap in places where I knew they looked for food. But seeing the results of this baiting method, I almost think it would be a good idea to put a little bait outside it as well, if I didn't know exactly where to put it.This is the first time in a month I haven't heard rustling in the kitchen when I'm not in the room. I'm very pleased with this trap.Here's my older review:Despite the title on this item, this is a Raticator.I live in the country surrounded by woods. When field mice found a way into the house this year, I bought one of these and a couple of smaller mouse-size electrical traps. (I have dogs so poison was out of the question, and I worried about old-fashioned mousetraps being inhumane.)Both have performed well, getting about a mouse a week, but the Raticator killed big mice that would have never wedged their way into the smaller traps.This trap is simple to set up. The only work is putting in the batteries, then finding the right spots to put them and the right bait. The bait that works at my house is a smidge of sunflower butter on alittle corner of bread. I slip it into the back on the tip of a table knife (with the current turned off, of course).It's also easy to get rid of the dead mice, and re-use immediately. They can also be cleaned when necessary. You can find instructions on the internet.The customer service is excellent. They answer the phone, give you advice, and send extra instructions (like how to test it) if you need it.Raticator works for me and I'm glad I spent the money on it.",57.0
14535,14536,"Having read about the difficulties some had installing this modem I approached installation with trepidation. Setup with Comcast in New Jersey was seamless. I connected the modem directly to my laptop (Ethernet) after attaching the Comcast cable and waited for the setup screen to appear in the Internet Explorer. I entered my account number and phone number, and waited for several minutes while the setup proceeded. When it had completed, I reattached the modem to my router, rebooted the router, and my Comcast telephone service and internet service were working normally except that my internet speed more than doubled. No phone calls and no problems!Update: I returned the old modem to Comcast and shortly thereafter got a call from Comcast advising me to call tech support, which I did. Apparently the web setup is not perfect and after several minutes on the phone they corrected the setup errors and now my internet speed is several times better than previously. It may be advantageous to call Comcast to do the setup rather than attempting the web based service.Update 2: I had more difficulty getting the eight dollars a month taken off of my Comcast bill than the setup of the modem. Comcast has obvious training problems with its employees: one actually told me that it was not possible for me to use my own telephony modem even while I was speaking with them using that very same device! This individual was in the process of transferring me to Comcast telephone support when I hung up in frustration. In addition, the identifying information of the new modem was supposedly not showing on the rep's screen, further increasing my frustration. So, I decided to wait 24 hours and give the Comcast systems time to process my information and then made another call,which lasted all of 2 minutes, and the new rep had my account straightened out.",32.0

It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much.I can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell. This should be plenty for a couple of batches, so I am planning on spending about 10 dollars on propane per batch.I would highly recommend this burner...no complaints whatsoever.",43.0

Unfortunately, Mother Nature conspired to not snow very much here in southern Nevada last winter and limited our time in the snow.  This year; however, is a different story. A friend and I traveled to Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks National Monument during Veteran's Day weekend.  We drove into a significant snow storm and after the weather cleared we hiked in fresh snow at Cedar Breaks.  Long story short, I'm glad we packed the gaiters for the trip.  Cedar Break's recieved over two feet snow during the storm and got the chance to use the gaiters over our hiking boots.  Overall, these gaiters did the trick during the hiking at 10,000ft keeping us dry in deep snow - these gaiters ride high up to the knee which is perfect for tall folks, like me.  The only miss with these gaiters are the strapping mechanism going under the boots, essentially, a string that needs to knotted.  It was a little challenging squaring away the knot when the air temperature was around 0 dgs, but, we were able to get the gaiters secured and we move about the mountain with the greatest of easy and comfort.

Aesthetically I liked it, I know my son will like it also because of the football and it matched with his green samsonite school bag.When the lunch bag arrived I sighed because it looked small but I tested it putting all the paraphernalia I send my son with to school. I will be detailed to give you an idea: 1 juice (Welch's 10fl. oz.)or Apple's and Eve box juice, 2 snacks (if it is the size of potato chips) 3 snacks if it is smaller packed snack like a granola bar or 4 biscuit snacks, 1 bowl for his lunch (approx 2 1/2"" deep 3"" wide square shaped), 1 small towel (so he can use as a table mat for his lunch), 1 small bottle of hand sanitizer (a 2 or 3oz bottle, small)  and 1 fork or spoon when necessary. Let me tell you, I dont regret buying that lunch bag for 1 second! Everything fit perfectly!We had issues with the last lunch bag we bought on amazon (not amazon's fault the make of the bag needed some tweaking for the use of a child) whenever my son held the handle the flap pulled with the weight due to the contents of the bag. Complete opposite with this lunch bag (besides it not having an opening flap) when my son holds this lunch bag containing the aforementioned items, its very manageable for a child and weighs (feels) almost 'light'. I dont know how that is possible but it is.Cleaning is easy, I guess you could follow the instructions. I just use a damp cloth and it wipes clean.

14641,14642,This is a simple and ingenious little invention.  I had about 10 bags worth of leaves to rake at the end of the season & it was so nice not having to wrestle with a lawn bag shoveling leaves into it.  This is very sturdy & you're able to really jam down the leaves without the bag buddy feeling flimsy at all and save yourself some money by not fully filling every yard bag.  Usually after raking I am miserable with a sore back the next day and this really saves you not having to bend all the way down to the ground.  The bag buddy works great for having BBQs out on the back deck as well with the guests being able to throw trash away.

If you want to read me complain that this DVD shortens it, well that was it.  Lucia is a dreamer. One day she meets the man of her dreams, Jose Simon but he doesn't have eyes for her. She's poor and he's one of the wealthiest men in Peru. While working at a flower shop she meets Roberto, whom she believes is also poor. She initially doesn't like him but soon they become friends. What Lucia does not know is that he is actually Jose Simon's brother and also wealthy. In a series of misunderstandings Lucia re-meets Jose Simon, but this time as an Italian countess. He immediately falls for her, or is it for her money? Now Lucia must decide if she loves the wealthy Jose Simon or the poor Roberto?  This novella ranks up in my top 3 of all time. While you don't get to see the entire series they do a decent job of showing you how things transpire. If you are debating getting this after never seeing I recommend you go for it.

I was so looking forward to it and was excited to receive an e-mail that it had arrived at my front door.  I raced home from work to do to do my chores that I had planned on quickly just so that I would have time to really sit back, enjoy and read the instructions and actually get to know the Wii. In the first hour and and a half I had ""carefully"" (literally, since this is my first ever expensive game I bought for myself) unpacked the game and had hooked it all up.  I even connected the Wii to the internet, downloaded Netflix and started to watch a movie that I had started on my laptop a few days ago.  Everything was going great until... I decided to play ""Just Dance 4"", the game came with the Wii Console, it was a bundle.  After all, why not try the game out since I was going to start working out to the game tomorrow that is why I actually but the console in the first place.  I started the game picked the song that I was going to dance to to and the entire console... JUST DIED!  It just ""cut-off""!  Now the game is stuck inside the darn thing and I can't get it out!  I tried to unplug the power supply and wait a few minutes because that's what the trouble shoot instructions said to do but nothing. I had the game plugged to a wall surge protector.  I'M SO DEPRESSED!  I really wanted this Wii because it is so much fun.  Reminds me when I played this particular game with my niece.  I knew from that moment on that I wanted to own one not only because it is fun but because it is a great way to stay in shape.  So here I am almost 4 hours later requesting a return which I really wanted a replacement but no can do and writing a review all on the same day of receiving it.",50.0

There's lots of clues suggesting where corners were cut to keep this price point, but the sound of this guitar IS NOT one of them.I bought this without a demo based on price and reviews and couldn't believe how good it sounded out of the box. When people say it sounds better than any $200 starter guitar, they're telling the truth.The things I haven't read from others are how brutal the factory setup and Martin strings (as nice as they sound) are on your fingers. It came with the action set WAY TOO HIGH. I was afraid that if I adjusted the truss bar and changed to light strings that it wasn't going to maintain its sound.  I was wrong.  I swapped out the Martin strings for Ernie Ball Earthwood 80/20 Light, and lowered the action by at least one full revolution of the truss bar, and it sounds even better now. AND it's much more playable.Even considering the price, this is not a 5 star instrument.  If you don't know how, or aren't comfortable making adjustments yourself, you'd probably spend as much to get it set up as you paid for it.  Otherwise, I would think any beginner would lose interest trying to tame this thing for any length of time. The spruce top alone is worth the extra $25 over the RA-90D, but its still a laminate, and despite the sound that it makes, it's clearly thrown together as quickly and easily as the plant in China can turn them out. It looks OK, but it's not a show piece, and parts of the structure look crude. I have little hope that it'll still be playable in 5 or more years. But at this price, who cares?",36.0

It is fool-proof in terms of how to lock it up - there is only one locking mechanism to close the top of the bag, so it's never left too far open for a sneaky hand to reach in.  Material is sturdy, easily wiped down if dirty.  This was recommended by full-time travelers, and I find it a very affordable ""insurance plan"" for my valuables.

14732,14733,"Great watch, amazing price, I picked it up for 55$ mid december and could not be happier with the quality. Easy to read, minutes on the outer loop, hours inner. Mine gains approximately 1.75 seconds per day, which is pretty good compared to other mechanical watches. The second hand cannot be adjusted by turning the crown, only the minutes and hours, so setting the second hand is not easy, or straightforward at all. It would be possible to let the watch unwind over time, and then start it up when the time matched the second hand, however that would be pointless.  Water resistent, not to be submerged, even swimming pools are not recommended. I personally do not shower with mine on, even if the watch could handle it, the band is cloth and will fade.  The illuminated hands glow All Night Long. When i wake up to a dark room at 6:50 am my watch is still very easily read. Being the child that I am I will often take a flashlight and hold it on against the dial, charging up the glow paint (not Tritium) to see just how bright they will get. I don't imagine this effects the life, but you should probably read up on that because it very well may.

14804,14805,"I've heard great things about these wrenches for a while and couldn't wait to get a set of my own. Unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed.  First, the blow mold case is exactly like the pic (which I guess makes sense) - there's no top, just what you see, which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever - I wouldn't take a star off for that.  I'm dropping stars because the sizing isn't right.  I've used the 10, 14, 17, and 18 so far.  The 18 is way off on the bolts I used it on (front suspension on my car).  The 5 deg. ratcheting does you no good if you've got 15 deg. of slop in the fit.  For the record, the bolt was an 18, and my other wrenches and sockets fit it perfectly.  The 10 was off as well, but not nearly as bad as the 18, and the others were close but still worse than most of my other tools.The other reason I drop a star is because they're flimsy and skinny.  With an XL set like this you expect more heft.  When I'm really pulling on the wrench it feels like it's going to flip over or crumple or something.  There's plenty of strength in the direction you need, but the thinness in the other direction doesn't inspire me to really pull on them, which is the point of an XL wrench.The good: They appear well made, nice finish, well marked, the ratcheting mechanism is crisp and solid.  The bad doesn't come out until you go to use it, and then it's just disappointing.",40.0
14805,14806,It is a nice little fire/BBQ pit for a backyard patio but it is high maintenance. First off the single poorly placed drain hole is useless if you burn anything which produces aches. I drilled three additional holes to help with drainage. Even with a cover this pit will start rusting within a few weeks so purchase a few cans of some good rust resistance paint and customize your pit to your liking. Other than the few expected issues I have enjoyed this pit.,12.0

14811,14812,"This is an excellent choice to mount your Kindle Fire HD 7 (4th Gen). Although the product description did not list the Kindle among the devices it will hold, I took a  chance based on the dimensions it listed being able to hold. The product is very well made, easy to install and holds on the the Kindle tightly. I was curious is mount could accommodate Kindle in the standing protective case but it did, and it fit so well that even with a good shake or two before I mounted it on the headrest, the Kindle held tightly in place and wouldn't budge. Being aware that flying objects inside a vehicle during an accident are very dangerous to a little one I wanted to make sure that the device was secure before mounting in front of my 2-year old. I like this product so much that I will recommend it to anyone, even an adult that would be sitting in the back seat and wants to mount a device to watch a movie on a long car ride.

14886,14887,"I got these for Christmas and I love them! I also got them for my brother. The ears are a little big for me, as they go down my neck a bit, but I am quite small so that's my problem. My brother is huge and he says they fit fine. I can wear these for 4 or so hours before starting to feel pain from the headband and clamp,(which is kind of hard not to have for this type of headphone). This wasn't a big issue for me because I only use them a couple of hours at a time, and I was willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort for quality, and even at that they are still pretty darn comfortable! Overall there isn't much clamp, it just builds up after uaing them for a long time. The ears themselves are comfortable (lined with a soft cushion) and provide AMAZING isolation!! These babies made the airplane drone sound like a gentle hum. The quality is superb if you're moving from Apple earbuds or Skullcandy's or beats--the beats really are bad quality for their price--anyway, music sounds clear and crisp and gives a bit of a soundstage effect. Drums can sometimes sound a little punchy, and there can be a big bass but both arent overwhelming. They are big so if portability is a must, these might not be for you, though the ears do fold over and it does come with a chic travel case...You just cant put them in your sweatshirt pocket or anything. DO NOT GET THE S CABLE IF YOU ONLY WANT TO USE THEM FOR YOUR COMPUTER/IPOD. I made that mistake and I had to get an adapter, which was only $7 from Radio Shack, but I'm not downrating the product as that mistake was my own.

14887,14888,love these nail filers ! i bought a set of the smaller ones for myself and they are the only ones i will use from now on.they are delicate ( i broke one carrying it in my purse ) but if you are careful you will have no problems.i ordered this set here because it has the larger file in it.my hubby is sick and needs his nails done by me.when i used the smaller pointed end ones i stuck it a few times in his toe.but the large round one solved that problem.im sooo happy with this product and would def. reccomend it ...thank you !,10.0

14889,14890,"I'm an idiot, a moron, am hopeless. When it comes to picking out ""GIRLIE STUFF""... Just ask my loving bride of over 35 years.  So when I saw this and I loved it, I KNEW it must be just awful. I had to try. She has spent 6 straight months nursing me after a LOT of ""stuff"" from surgical complications etc. She gave up 3 weeks of her vacation and a lot more to care for me tirelessly. I saw this and HAD to at least try. It was so affordable I knew it was something I could afford to lose money on if another failure.  To my amazement she LOVES this, and her love for it is genuine. When an old dingbat ..... oh wait....when my beloved little bride gets that ""look"" on her face, you know, the kind when she is going to cry and you PANIC but then pause since you soon realize it is going to be ""happy tears""? Well that is what I got. I was tempted to tell her I loved her so much that all these precious diamonds were NOTHING compared to my love of her. But I figured I would get just about half of that out of my mouth before a plate would be flying across the room with my name on it:-)  So in reality, while I wish with all my heart that I COULD give her real diamonds and precious stones. I Wish I could give her everything in this world AND the next, whatever that may be. But I CAN give here this and tell her I love her and hope to be a better and more well hubby and that will have to do for now. In the meantime this earns a full 5 stars. It looks AMAZING for the cost and is an honestly very nice product that made my wife show me those big ""little girl"" eyes again for the first time in a long time. What a bargain!",57.0

14911,14912,"I've been using Kettlebells for ~ 15 years as part of my martial arts routine and know firsthand how useful these things can be for both men and women who want to strengthen and stabilize their core, burn fat, and build muscle. Sure, weights can do the same thing, but Kettlebells have certain advantages, not the least of which is that they're fun and easy to use. The kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, hence utilizes more muscles than traditional dumbbells, meaning that a kettlebell workout is more effective and yields better results in less time too. What I hadn't found until now was useful instruction for those who have played around with them but want something more. Lorna Kleidman clearly knows her stuff, she is a 3-time Kettlebell World Champion, author, and coach, and it shows in the instruction. Ignoring the tutorial (~ 20 min) which you'll only need a couple of times, the DVD has a ~40 minute exercise routine, and ~ 4 minute cool down covering intermediate Kettlebell exercises. This makes for a well-produced, easy to follow, useful workout. You will need two Kettlebells for this routine (Lorna suggests ~ 10-15lb and 20-25lb for woman and ~ 15-20lb and 30-35lb for men) and a mat or towel, all of which are easily available at most any sporting goods store or online.",22.0

14919,14920,"I love every second of this buggy, I also brought the bassinet which is from birth, although my son came out of the bassinet just before 4 months he was very safe in the stroller and more happier. I found it was heavy at first and in talking about the first two months but now 4 months down the line it's as light as a feather. I also brought the weather cover which i have to say I have got my knickers in a twist trying to hurry to pop it on before the heavens opened up, it was really easy putting over the bassinet but the stroller I'm only just remembering which way it goes knickers still get twisted but not as bad as before, it's also great the zip lets you peep into baby without getting him wet. I also brought the USB phone charger absolutely love it although you do have to walk a certain speed to get your phone charging. I do have to admit I did brake down the once but that was due to I was unaware in cold weather cases ie. Winter you have to keep the buggy warm and charged at least once a week through mains. Folding the buggy in manual was so easy I did have to check out youtube to know how but one view and I was away with the fairies. I absolutely love this buggy although everyone called me a snob, yes it is expensive I also got called stupid but it's worth it. The lights come high or low I use the low setting when I walk in dull days and the high setting when walking at night. Most normal buggies you have to tilt back to climb a curb, I dont I mean I don't do it on purpose I literally completely forgetting but the front wheels have the ability to climb a curb without the tilting action. I used to think there was a down side to this buggy, the buggy does tilt back if you have shopping on the handle.. I found out through my own experience if you put 2 shopping bags over each cup holder it doesnt tilt back also either milk, formula, pop, canned food... all go into the bag by the wheels where I also keep the weather cover.

I love the concept of a french press and the taste this one produces is quite nice compared to other methods I've tasted.  This FP is larger than I expected and as the only person using it my home, I wish I had purchased a smaller one, but I suppose it will be useful when having guests.  What I didn't realize with making your own coffee is the need to use a 1/4 cup of grounds just to produce one 12 oz cup of coffee.  Why do all these companies consider 1 cup to be 4 oz.? Who drinks 4 oz. of coffee unless it's an espresso???? I find that a little misleading.  Secondly, it doesn't keep the coffee hot enough for more than 5 minutes.  Understandably so since it is glass.  I realize if I wanted to keep it hotter longer, I probably should have bought an insulated all stainless steel FP, but I wanted to be able to see it brewing.  To deal with that issue, I just try to time it properly.  Overall, this french press seems like good quality. I like its simple, streamlined design.

People, shut the hell up with you shit talk. If your disappointed because the PSN doesn't have all the psp games or because the games are more expensive, I don't blame you. I was disappointed until I found out about a legal way to play all of the psp games on the psp go. No it's not free unless you already have the game you want in UMD format. Buy the game disc, or ask a friend to give you any unwanted psp games. Then, get a CUSTOM FIRMWARE for your psp go. Using custom firmware is completely legal. Next, download the backup files of the games you bought/ were given. Search up how to play iso's on a psp if you don't already know. Before you start thinking that this is illegal, let me say one thing. IT IS NOT ILLEGAL! As long as you have the original disc (new, used, or even broken for god sake), it is legal to play the backups. Now that way you pay less, and get all the games that were released for the psp. There you have it. Now you have less to whine about, maybe nothing at all anymore. The PSP go is the perfect portable system. You get a massive amount of built in memory space ( perfect for games, music, etc.). The small size is perfect to fit in your pocket. All in all, this is the perfect handheld.",56.0

15041,15042,"I am a neophyte with telescopes and decided that for what I want to do, this would be a good entry model for me.  I was mostly interested in looking at and photographing the moon, maybe some planets, and possible use it for other celestial background photo work.  It was also a shot at getting my feet wet before I plopped down thousands of dollars to find out I got the wrong stuff.  Turns out this is a good choice to cut my teeth and learn lessons.  The unit is fairly rugged, self-contained, and more or less sealed so you can't accidentally mess something up.  It is heavy...too heavy for even the best camera tri-pod.  Combine that with the Earth's habit of rotating objects out of your field of view fairly quickly, you need a specifically designed tri-pod to handle it.  I got the one from Celestron with the azimuth controls so once I get the moon in the telescopes sights, I can rotate some knobs and keep it in view.  That works well without having to invest in a ""clock"" type mount.  Photography can be done a couple of ways without investing in those purpose built units which are big on price tags and low in resolution.  The first way is to use an adapter to mount a digital SLR body to the unit. The second is what I did, which is another adapter from Celestron that allows you to mount a point-and-shoot type digital camera behind the eyepiece.  I used an Olympus TG-2 which worked really well, once you got everything aligned.  In some ways, using the rear display of the camera is easier to find and keep your subject in frame.  As for the actual quality of the image, I am not an expert.  It seems very crisp to me and I don't seem to see any color issues.  What is important is setting the unit up correctly.  You need to use some local object to ""sight in"" the cross-hairs in the spotter scope to match what you see in the telescope.  Once that is done, it is far easier to find your astronomical targets.  It is still weird getting used to the idea of getting my eyes aligned directly behind the eyepiece and about an inch away from it.  I also like that the image is ""right side up"" like a binocular view rather than the flipped over version most telescopes have.  This will allow me to use it for nature viewing as well.  This unit will get me through my learning phase until I know better what I want and how much money I am willing to spend.  I have attached two photos.  One is of the telescope on the tripod with the digital camera adapter.  The other is the first photo of the moon I took with it.",73.0

I am not a doctor, I have no medical knowledge of how this would work, I am only speaking from my own experience. I also feel a prolonged boost from these.

15085,15086,"Calphalon LX Series knives feature traditional German style blades with thick spines, hefty weight, forged full tang construction.  This chef's knife has a highly curved cutting edge that facilitates mincing by rocking the blade between the heel and point.  Recommendation:  Before buying, remove the knife from the box and see if its weight and balance match your preferences.  The blade is labeled ""GERMAN STEEL MADE IN CHINA.""  Calphalon customer support advised that both the steel and the knife were made in China, but declined to identify the alloy. In my sample, the blade was sharp out of the box. The edge quality is easily maintained with a few strokes on a sharpening steel. The alloy is not a super-hard exotic steel, but holds its edge well enough in practical use. Hand wash and dry promptly after using.  Manufacturer offers lifetime warranty after user registration.  The LX Series knives have been discontinued.  They have been offered at substantial savings in off-price stores.",39.0

Do like I do and use a Roku for HD streaming and let my other ""dumb"" devices just do what they were primarily built to do.

Recently, my doctor recommended the Spenco Full Support Orthotics to me.  I was happy to see that I could get it here on Amazon and in the realm of things affordable.  Ordered a pair. put them in my  size 9 med. width tennis shoes then in my boots, and found them to be snug, so I trimmed them down. Read on the back that the hard plastic were moldable if needed.  Put them in my shoes, and they were VERY wide, so I followed the directions and tried to melt some of the plastic so that they would fit.  No luck.  Even took them to a shoe repair to see if they could help.  No luck, but they recommended the thin or dress shoe Spenco full length orthotic a size down, which are narrower, and did fit in my tennis shoe much better. Walked out of the store with them in my shoes.  Great Support, Great Product, Ladies my I suggest you start out with the dress orthotic if you are not a wide width.  The other pair is sitting in the box in my closet. To wide for any of my shoes, and to small for my husband shoes.",44.0
