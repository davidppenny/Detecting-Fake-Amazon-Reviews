It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!!

40,41,"My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a ""fat burner"" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)",31.0

I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!!

I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it.

Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad.

They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss.

After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more ""smooth"" feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running.

Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.In ""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.",16.0

501,502,"Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.",31.0

T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install.

The sheath is very well designed, with a ""rubber"" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, ""rough"" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick!

587,588,"I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.You won't be disappointed.

The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.

I gained many great ideas from that book, including different apps and websites that make flipping my Geometry class streamlined. I received an e-mail notification from Amazon that this book was released, so I gave it a try.PROS:-The book was filled with stories that tied into a lesson, idea, or philosophy.-This was not a textbook style book, instead, it was a compilation of 21 stories or ideas.-I feel that the author is very positive towards education and it's just another reminder of why I love what I do.-There were several ideas to help engage my students , encourage them to work to the best of their ability, and be the best that they can be in life.CONS:-I knew that the length of the book prior to ordering, but I wish it was a bit longer.-Unlike the ""flipped class"" book that the author wrote, this book is not as cohesive and each chapter reads more like a separate book - good and bad. Overall, 4 stars.",13.0

998,999,"I lost a lot of weight taking these raspberry ketones, but I really wanted to lose it faster than this. I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.",30.0

1031,1032,This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back.

1262,1263,"This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it.",46.0

1268,1269,"Alright, this is a review that is based on my first week of experience. Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.",82.0

1367,1368,"Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a ""Product of China‚Äù. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.It is useful to read ""SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA‚Äù and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online.

After 10 minutes of use she told me this was not worth the money I spent and directed me to buy something different.I can say that this stylus does NOT take notes very well and you spend more time trying to correct the poor results than just trumping a note or using a cheapie stylusI've decided that my 5 dollar griffin will do better than this 70 dollar toyMy search continues for a good active stylusTrust me and avoid this at all costs,8.0

1603,1604,"I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.",28.0

No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish.

Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life.

I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book.

It is some time hard to follow and digest. Questions are not as good as the first one.  Head First: I also like this book because it makes sense and easy to follow.  I think a lot of ppl will not appreciate cartoons and images in a PMP book but I liked it.  Questions are not too good but comparing others it does a good job.  http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-PMP-Jennifer-Greene/dp/1449364918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381221&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+pmp",50.0

The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes.

Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand.

They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor.

Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.

I bought a total of 6 of these at 2 different times. My tests show that on average, they don't even measure up to a 1/3 of the 3000 mAh level claimed by UltraFire. One went totally dead after using only once.Furthermore, they only have about the same power level as found in a triple pack of AAA batteries.Therefore, buying these batteries makes no sense at all.

2285,2286,"Actually the belief that ""Hell is for Real"" isn't a funny matter. It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain.Fear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to ""Hell Is for Real.""""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others.""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is ""a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air.""",34.0

In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.

The movie shows us good people and bad people (in predictable roles on both sides of the fighting). The direction and filmography are similar to Band of Brothers (for obvious reason). It is technically and visually excellent.The failing of the movie, I believe, is that it can't compare to The Thin Red Line in terms of message(both came out the same year). Although clearly showing that ''war is bad,'' Ryan fails to show us the underlying cause (people, even good people, are corrupt and inhuman).

I had 60K actuation and it never fail me before, but know this happened and don't know what to do. I tried all known methods/tricks to give back it's power but nothing worked.This camera can give you the level of pixels you expect for 18MP and the fast performance when it comes to focusing. However, you should know that you also need a good lens to get sharp images, trust me. Use prime lenses. they're tact sharp. zoom lenses have sweet spots but when you use prime lens you'll get what you want!If you really want a DSLR that will last I think you should change your mind and get an inexpensive model instead and just invest in lenses. DSLRs have a life span and you'll regret if you spend a lot of money on a full frame or a semi pro DSLRs and after 3+ years it will be dead and unusable. I've been there, trust me.",30.0

The previews looked promising and fun.  But something about the movie just felt...off.  None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters.  it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent.Overall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim.",24.0

A tip I recommend is to always put more into each set that you do for better/quicker results. I love how the mother engages you by being active through EVERY single workout. She pushes you to finish.As far as the daughter's workouts, very ""squaty."" That's pretty much all she does, besides give instructions on what you should be doing instead of demonstrating. I love all the leg workouts she does in her segment, and I really love all the Ab workouts. I really don't watch her anymore, but I use the other lady in the back, Christy. She does everything. As she pushes, I push.Complaints: The low audio quality. The sound is drowned out by the background and my the music. You have to turn up the DVD to a higher than normal level to hear what is being said. Also there is some issue with the transitions into forms with Lana's portion.In case you are wondering, you DO NOT have to follow the meal plan associated with the DVD. I used my own regular foods, at a lower rate than I would normally do. I just eat smaller portions, and eat more (wise food choices) frequently. I can tell a huge difference in just one week of working out. You have to have SOME sort of diet or discipline. Just because you workout, does not mean you will lose weight, you must also watch you intake.Good luck ladies. You can follow me on IG if you like @XIjaneiX",64.0

I got it here on Amazon and wish I would have purchased it instead in the first place. It works well and stays on during use no matter how long I have it on for. It feels well made and I can't find a single thing to complain about after owning it for a month.If you want a quality elliptical, get the same one I did here on Amazon ------------> http://amzn.to/1rf8bogI hope my experience helps keep others from making the same mistake I did and getting this elliptical!",17.0

I was wrong.DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!!The Beats Pill is easy to pair with the iPhone and the sound is great. However, after 40-45 min, the connection breaks and the music stops.

I used my son's iPhone 5 and had the exact same problem.I visited the Apple store (where they sell this item) and asked if they knew of any problems.

Sure, the sound was better from the Beats Pill and the look is definitely more appealing. But, I am not getting rid of my iPhone.I am an Apple person and own iPads, iPhones, iPods, and MacBooks.

The book is entitled Geometry but it covers most aspects of mathematics. The Elements and the Structure of geometry are not Set Theory. Of course a geometric object could be interpreted by the set theory, but geometry is not set theory nor is set theory geometry. This is as good as saying physics is mathematics. Interpreting a line as an infinite set of points denies the very essence of what is a line. Geometric object are visualization of physical things and it has rooms in our mind, infinity is a pure abstract philosophy of mathematics and has no room in our imagination.

3031,3032,"If you are reading this review prior to buying and installing the product, do this RIGHT NOW - buy a 14 mm tap with a thread pitch of 1.5. My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.We put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. ""How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn't be a problem,"" we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that's why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.Once my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn't have to struggle.We have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn't require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.I also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.The hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.This hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars.",70.0

In other words, it does exactly what you'd expect a ""point-and-shoot"" camera to do: take great pictures.However, it doesn't work well with the flash, and it has a very dark quality when recording video in low light. If you can handle using small flush buttons and going through multiple menu items to erase a picture or toggle between manual and automatic pictures, then it's worth your while.

3096,3097,"Ink is such a ripoff, but especially this kind. I hate HP ink! And let me tell you WHY! Because the crap hardly lasts and it's a complete ripoff. ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business. I print two copies of every return, one for my records and one for sending in (I don't e-file). I printed 38 pages this year, 2014. Let me spell that out for you: T-H-I-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T P-A-G-E-S...And that's it! The ink is GONE. R-I-P-O-F-FI don't know what the solution is for this BS printer and ink problem we have right now, but I know it's NOT buying these HP cartridges because they suck!",42.0

They support your feet and for my preference it's perfect it might be different for other people but I was told you want good hard support. Just having a gel sole will ware and start to hurt. With these they cup your heal comfortably and have two vent holes on the inside portion of the boots.

3256,3257,"I read some reviews warning about lead contamination in Chinese Matcha. I read up on the issue. I found that lead contamination is certainly a big problem with Chinese matcha. Research done in 2006 by Han and his associates at the Key Laboratory of the Ministry Of China called ""SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA"" reported that 32% of 1225 samples of Chinese tea exceeded the MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE CONCENTRATION of LEAD!!! It is a real danger that we all should be aware of. Another study has shown that even organic green tea from China contains lead!!!Lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen, 1999). I understand that the contaminated water enters agricultural soil in water irrigation systems which obtain water from the river. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a definite risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!!!Interestingly, this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is much better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was ""not measurable""Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), nervous system (including the brain) and bones!!!The way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. In 2013, ConsumerLab.com advised people NOT TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until they are sure about the purity of the matcha!!!It says in the CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS section that uVernal told a customer called Barbara Zaretsky that uVernal matcha is made in China. As lead contamination is a big problem in Chinese matcha, I believe that the actual laboratory report should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the uVernal so that we can all read the results and get some PEACE OF MIND! Until then, I am NOT AT ALL HAPPY to drink this Chinese matcha. Once I see the laboratory report uploaded on Amazon, I'll write more about this product.",54.0

If Olajuwon, Ewing, Duncan, Robinson, Sabonis, Mutombo, Daugherty, Mourning, Divac, Smits, Shaq, etc heck even Yao was playing back in the Chamberlain & Russel days, when NBA was fractured & wasn't fully established- no 3 in the key, no shot clock violation, no 3 pointer, etc, only a few teams, the average height of a player was around 6'3,only a few Black players, etc. they could have average 50 ppg, 20 rpg, had 11 rings & scored 100 points. I laugh at the idiots who are comparing NBA in the 50s-70s to NBA from 80's til today. Wilt & Russel wouldn't stand a chance against PF & C that I mentioned above.Jordan said it himself that Hakeem is better than Russel, Kareem, & Wilt & stated that he will take Hakeem over any Center in NBA history & I agree. No Center in NBA history is more quick, agile, better shot blocker, the ONLY C that's top 10 in steals, better footwork & had better post moves than Hakeem regardless who you think his better. Can you honestly say if Russel & Chamberlain would have came in the late 80s & 90s when NBA was at it's peak at defense, PF & C position do you think he would have 11 rings & scored 100 points? People need get over the fact that NBA is 100 times more competitive than it was in the 50's-70's ESPECIALLY in the 90s.

3377,3378,"BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!! Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.I believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!I was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was ""below the measurable limit"" :)The reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones!

3419,3420,"Cello prices are very expensive in the DC area string shops, and many of them are Chinese made (professionally set-up).  My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow.  If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.The sound isn't as good as my child's 1/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult ""helper"" was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.Tip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast. I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are ""brighter"" sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.The bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.Price is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.  Sound is deep and mellow.***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings.",36.0

Child was able to play without hurting their mouth anymore.That said, comparing my old Vito with this instrument really shows the difference in manufacturing practices, for the worse.  The Vitto was a student instrument and it looks so good compared to this brand.  The Vito is easier to play.  You don't need to force as much air through to get a good, clear tone.  The tone of this clarinet is deeper, need to adjust mouth and breath to get be in tune with electric tuner teacher uses.

3747,3748,"Title says it all... You can do much better as far as sound quality for far less money. They have decent bass, stylish looks, fair build quality, but simply are not the headphones for serious listeners.They performed pretty good on hip-hop, but if you are into anything else, and expect $200 worth of sound, these fall way short. In fact for half the money, you can get a set of Sennheisers that out perform these hands down.In my opinion they are simply a name brand fashion accessory and not a performance headphone. Guess it boils down to:Are you looking for great sounding headphones? - these are not it. They get points for style, and bass performance is solid.Mids and upper frequencies are muddy and lack luster. They simply fall flat for most music.Are you looking for a fashion accessory and don't really care much for sound over looks and branding? These are your headphones. They do look nice, are fairly comfortable for semi-long wear. They have a solid ( but boomy ) bass response, but really.... At $200, they are just over priced bling.To each their own, I think if people were honest, they couldn't possibly justify the price to performance, had they actually listened to some good headphones. Or perhaps they just need to attempt a justification for spending $200 on these, but bottom line is: if you want performance, sound quality, build quality, and maybey not so much the looks and the branding. You can do much much better in a set of Grados or Sennheisers. If you just want ridiculous bass you can get the Klipsch for $50 less and they sound just as good, if not better. I can't tell ya what you like, but I know good sound... And you may have noticed I didn't mention several other over priced branded headphones that I seen others mention. Basically for all the same reasons... You can do a lot better for a lot less money. But even if you decided to buy a $200-$300 set of Grados or Sennheisers, you are gonna get what you paid for, and they will completely destroy the branded price equivalent.That's my opinion : )",45.0

And the itemization is beyond awful. I also purchased this game in anticipation of arena/pvp. But with the induction of the RM-AH, it's essentially just going to be a ""pay2win"" form of pvp.One thing that was particularly painful for me was the fact that when you 1st play the game, you can only play it in Normal difficulty. Beating the game on Normal unlocks the next difficulty, and so on and so forth. This is beyond stupid and was done just to keep people logging time in the game. Normal difficulty is a joke.

3922,3923,"First, I bought this through digital purchase on the Blizzard website, but I think getting as much negative press out there to prevent more gamers from falling for this ponzi scheme is important.Warning: If you purchase this game, you are willingly becoming a human node to farm profit for Blizzard. The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: ""The World of Auctions"" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?Then there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.Just do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience.",44.0

Unless this documentary and the so-called ‚Äúscientists"" involved in it has the support of over 97% of actual scientists as is the case with supporting the reality of global warming, I call complete BS on this film. Again, if you have a science degree that makes you an expert on this issue, feel free to contradict the overwhelming majority. Go ahead, I DARE YOU...",21.0

3987,3988,"I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper. Its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  First, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. Anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon MUST BE SEALED. The activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. So, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. My filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. These should be sealed at the factory. I placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when I got it so hopefully there is still some life left. Being curious as to what I might expect in terms of shelf life, I checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. It was mostly marketing hype. They apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. So, I went to Renovo Trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. I found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. According to Renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters OR 1 year out of its packaging (the Renovo is hermetically sealed). So, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before I received it, then I've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. Don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but I paid for a three stage filter and that is what I was expecting.  Second, a week or so after ordering this, I get some telemarketer calling from Survivor Filter trying to get my email and other details so I can end up on some marketing list. I have NEVER had this happen on Amazon and I hope it doesn't become the norm.  So, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).",56.0

4001,4002,"The Wire is one of my favorite shows of all time. I wasn't aware of it when it was still airing on HBO, but after hearing rave reviews I decided to purchase the box set and go from there. As my opening sentence asserts, that was a great decision.Except for the quality of the actual discs. Like others on here have mentioned, this box set is just not up to par. Four of my discs had disc read issues, and one of them managed to completely stop working mid-season. I've since had the entire set replaced, and although the new one works much better, from time to time it still skips or pauses randomly. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what happened during the production run of these as writing DVDs is usually a rather simple process, but something was definitely up.I wouldn't normally recommend this as I'm a firm believer that piracy is wrong, but my suggestion would be to buy the set so the cast and crew get their royalties and also downloading a digital copy for pain-free viewing. It's not illegal if you own the product, and honestly it'll save you quite a few headaches. I'm not going to provide you with a link, but let's just say it's not too hard to find if you're so inclined.I don't want to write a mini review on the series as there's many others out there, but I will say that the extra features in this set are fantastic and absolutely worth the price.

A good old fashioned sword-wielding adventure in which Casca and his band of new mercenaries, made up from different tribes, must rescue the princess from a foreign land.With a daring trip along the river by boat, the band must save the crew and a rather dodgy captain from the attack of the tribesman, who have a vendetta against Mattias. As the tale unravels, one of the group is killed and Casca begins to investigate, who was it? As the clues drop he begins to suspect that all is not as it seems.Not everyone is who they claim they are, and it was a fascinating and brutal end to the story. Saddler would have been chuffed if he could have written this, I don't mean to over do it, but without offending anyone, I think mr Roberts is becoming just as big a talent as Saddler ever was.. There isn't much between the stories mr Roberts is producing now and the best from Saddler.Just like to point out that Mattias is such a great character, the best in any of the Roberts era, bar casca himself obviously.I vaguely remember someone saying in an earlier review that mr Roberts tried to make casca seem like a '1970s touchy feely guy'..

4147,4148,"I think the reason supplements get such widely mixed reviews is that everyone is looking for a magic pill. They want to make no other changes, take a pill and want the fat to melt away. I have never heard of anything that's ever happened like this.Personally I was in what is considered the 'overweight' range for my height and build. Everyone said I looked great and scoffed at the idea of being 'overweight', but I kind of felt it. Clothes were getting snug and I wasn't comfortable with my own appearance. So I set out to get into the 'healthy' weight range by dropping 20 lbs. or so. I started a regular regimen of exercise and began to watch my caloric intake. After about 8 or 9 weeks I had plateaued after losing about 12-13 lbs. It was frustrating - my weight even slipped up a bit even though I continued my diet and exercise program.I did the research on coffee bean extract. Naturally the reviews are all over the place. I figured I didn't have a lot to lose by trying it out, so I got a bottle of this stuff. I'm through the first bottle now and the weight loss is staggering. I immediately blew through the plateau and I've dropped another 10 lbs. in 4 weeks. I've reached my goal but now I'm getting greedy. I'm wondering whether I continue losing to get to the mid-point of the 'healthy' range. I'm very close and there's still a bit of flab here and there that I'd like to see go away. I did still continue with my exercise program at the same time.Again, if you're looking for a magic pill move on. In my opinion, and I'm certainly no expert, these supplements only work in combination with changing the behaviors that got you overweight in the first place. This one seems to work extremely well when applied in that fashion.",54.0

I love how it is so powerful and gets every drop of juice from the lemon or lime out. I also like that the juice does not squirt all over. In the past on my previous juicer I have had juice squirt in my eyes all over the counter and not go where I wanted to go. Now the juice falls straight down to the glass. No seeds and no pith, that is trapped in the bowl. I have been looking for recipes now that use citrus juice since this is so easy to use for me. Fresh lemonade or lemon bars very easy to make now.The press is made of food-safe aluminum material with a beautiful coating. It won't rust, scratch, pit or crack.

There are several settings which are much more sophisticated than those you get on Xmas tree lights, house plant, or other decorative projects.

The battery could last up to 14 days and the on/off timer setting is great.

I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].

You will also see a big change since fingerprints and the oils they leave behind are a thing of the past.The installation process is actually very easy but you must read the directions. You will find everything you need in the package. You start by cleaning off your phones screen with the wipe they enclosed, and then dry it. Then you line up the openings, and lay it down on the screen. You get no bubbles at all. If you need to move it you just carefully lift it off and do it again. There is no residue left behind. They did a great job with all the cutouts for the camera and everything else that made it easy to make everything line up.You have to be crazy to use the old fashioned plastic sheets to protect your screen.

4750,4751,"This dimmer cord helps for those lamps which don't dim on their own and one does not have a dimmer wall switch.My friend has one of these:http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0000DI241/ I have about five of these in my home. All have worked well with no problems over the years. However, there is one thing that I would strongly point out. Not all of these dimmer cords have a light on the dimmer box. I accidently got one without the light and it makes it difficult to find in the dark. The light is turned on at the dimmer box and if there is no light on the box to tell you where it is in the dark room, it can be hard to find. This problem is solved if one makes sure that the dimmer box has a small light on it. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is that the outlet plug (into which the lamp plug needs to be inserted) is oriented perpendicular to the wall. If one has a lamp which has a similar outlet plug then with that lamp plug inserted in the dimmer plug which is inserted into the wall, the whole plug component is sticking about 4-6 inches out from the wall. If the outlet plug is behind a bookcase or furniture, this can be a problem. Even with a lamp plug that is flat, it will stick out several inches. Make sure there is enough space between the wall outlet and what is covering this unsightly mix of plugs and cords.",31.0

This squeezer works great for smaller/medium sized lemons and limes. You can get much more juice out of the lemons than hand squeezing.  If your lemons are too big, you can even cut them in quarters to fit and them use the squeezer. This squeezer is durable and very easy to use.",28.0

I usually drink it cold, although it tastes good hot too.  I drink tea daily, mostly for the taste and energy, but I am always happy to add antioxidants to the body whenever I can.I will also drink black tea which usually has a higher caffeine content for energy; [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]].  I do like the taste of the green tea better, but when it comes to using it as a source of energy, black tea still performs better for me.  This is also probably due to the fact that the instant black tea powder I use doesn't come in bags so it is easier to make a ""strong"" cup.  I will usually fill a large water bottle (about a quart) and add two heaping teaspoons of the tea powder, and sip throughout the day.  This works out to be a ton of caffeine but it keeps me wired like no other.This is why I like this green tea that comes with the ginseng so much.  It is not sooo much caffeine and I am using another source of energy besides just the caffeine content.  The ginseng, I'm sure, is what makes it so much more expensive but since I do not drink it every day, I think it is not that bad.",26.0

4877,4878,"Lots of people have enjoyed the Annapurna Circuit using this guidebook, which is a well established successful independent guidebook, written by a trekker for trekkers. The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.The guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called ""print on demand"" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.All I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.Ian Johnsonianpjohnson@yahoo.com",23.0
4878,4879,"When you enter the world of Ken Frazier and Sam Flagg, you never know what to expect.  In this tale, J.T. Prescott has masterfully succeeded in dispelling misperceptions often held about those within the retirement generation.  When retired seniors Ken, Craig and Bill invite the more youthful and physically capable Sam Flagg into their circle of trust, they band together and use their collective ""arts and crafts"" and set out on a dangerous mission to uncover a government conspiracy that involves killing an untold number of unsuspecting american people.  The supporting characters are really developed and well written. You can certainly expect exciting action scenes with unexpected twists and turns along the journey.  This is an entertaining and interesting read. Arts and Crafts has an underlying topic that left me with a feeling of hope and a renewed respect and admiration for a sometimes overlooked retirement aged population.  I was reminded about the special knowledge and wisdom that can only be taught by those who have a lifetime of experiences to share.  Looking forward to a sequel.........",32.0

I like trying new ways of making coffee and having it quick so when I could get this French press at a great price of course I had to. And since I love it so much I wanted to share my thoughts on it.

4972,4973,I had purchased another DVD player on amazon but it died and I had to return it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ANVQWU?tag=a9000-20  After doing some research I came across this one! Features include the usual gamut plus a very nice speed-control which I've never seen on a DVD player (but then I'm not an aficionado so what do I know ha ha). Simply pressing that particular button on the remote allows one to speed up or slow down playback with FULL sound! Really cool. I'm going to like this button for chick flicks! (Shhh ... you didn't hear me say that!) LoL  It's also half the size of the now-deceased DVD player so I recovered some shelf space as well. Sweet.  I'll update this if there are any untoward events but my experience with Sony gear (going back to before the Walkman) has always been excellent. Hopefully this is an aspect of Akio's company that lives on.  I recommend you pick up one of these: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00THLNVY0?tag=a9000-20  I hope this review was helpful.

Having a good study resource for the Registered Dietetic Technician exam is essential to you and your future clients' well-being.Flashcards are a great way to study for an exam.

For example, explore food and nutrition sciences, foodservice systems, nutrition care of individuals and groups and more.

Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.Frustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.It's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road.
